          Camp Naladhu is a ecological camp, where you can enjoy of nature, mountains, jungle and culture of rural village. It is located on the way to Kandy, approximately 60 km away from Kandy. The name of Naladhu means "Tranquility" in Sinhalese language.

The camp is situated in a private land (5 Ha) surrounding by mountains. This area is a good area for hiking in the morning and in the afternoon you can enjoy in a beautiful sun set with amazing view in front of you.

The Camp has a 4 rooms bungalow which is surrounded by trees and mountain. Each room has a private balcony with chairs where you can relax after you finish your day trips. Every room has an attached bathroom with hot water shower facilities. We have also 2 connecting rooms which can be booked together for families or friends who want to travel together. In the camping ground there are 3 tents available for rent at reasonable price to accommodate 2-3 persons each tent (please enquire from us).

Naladhu also have a camping ground where we can accommodate our guests, but this space will only be used if we have enough people staying at Naladhu during that time frame, because it is an ecological camp we do not use any chemical product to kill mosquito or any kind of insects so if there are many mosquitoes around our guests will not feel comfortable during their stay so please consider this before booking your stay at Naladhu for camping activities if you have big family or group. We will do our best to keep them out from our camping ground but there are jungle surroundings so it may happen from time to time that some mosquitoes come inside the campsite and we cannot prevent this 100%.
