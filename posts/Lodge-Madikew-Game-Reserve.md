          Lodge Madikew Game Reserve is a rural lodge with only two bedrooms. The emphasis here is on experiencing the wildlife up close and personal, which is why this lodge does not offer game drives. As you rest at the lodge after a day of game viewing, keep an eye out for elephants that stroll through the gardens.

The Madikew Lodge does not have any tented camps; however there are 14 tented chalets (with double beds) within walking distance of the main lodge. Each chalet has an en-suite bathroom with hot showers, towels and bedding. There are also outdoor showers for those who wish to shower under the African sky.

There are two private bush bathrooms with hot showers and toilets, which are shared by 16 chalets within walking distance of the main lodge. A game drive vehicle can transport guests to their toilet block between 8:30 am and 10 pm.
