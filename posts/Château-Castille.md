          Château Castille is a charming château, set in the heart of the Dordogne, between Sarlat and Bergerac. We offer 2 guest rooms (2 double beds 1 single bed) each with private bathroom (with bath or shower). A continental breakfast is served daily for our guests at 8:00 am. The property is 1 Km away from the beautiful village of St Astier, where you can enjoy a wide range of restaurants, bars and shops. Make sure to visit the famous Maison de la Dentelle de St-Yrieix , where you can find one of the most impressive collections of lace in France. The château is just 500 m from a lovely fishing lake, which is very popular with young children and families due to its proximity to the château. Fishing rods are available for our guests to use free of charge.
