Inn Rift Valley is a spiritual inn where you can feel the presence of God. Our room was very clean and the staff was really friendly. I highly recommend staying there.

The beds were so comfortable and I just loved the decor! The breakfast was delicious as well as the personal service from the staff. It was a great weekend getaway with my sister and I will definitely be returning soon!
