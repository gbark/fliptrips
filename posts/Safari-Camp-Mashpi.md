          Safari Camp Mashpi is a rustic safari camp in the Ecuadorian Amazon. It's located near the Napo River in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, in the east of the country.

From here you can explore several different areas of Yasuni National Park, including Shi Shi beach (a sandy beach, known for its wildlife) and Quilotoa Lake (an extinct volcano lake). You can also go on day trips to half-day visits to indigenous communities in the area.
