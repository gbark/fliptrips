          Private Island Ocean Sunset is a gorgeous private island and resort in the Maldives that was also designed by Bjarke Ingels Group. The resort features a hanging garden, a grotto, and a dining pavilion.

The Hanging Garden is located at the highest point of the island and is accessible by footbridge. It is built with the concept of ‘mountain meets ocean’ in mind and is surrounded by white sandy beaches and azure waters.

The grotto is a cave-like structure built into a small island that has been covered in rocks to provide shade from the sun while allowing water to cascade down its walls. It features a waterfall that pours into a pool below where guests can relax while taking in the view of the ocean.

Bjarke Ingels Group’s private island resorts are redefining what it means to be on vacation.
