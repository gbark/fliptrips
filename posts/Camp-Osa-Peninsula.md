Camp Osa Peninsula is a spiritual camp featuring the 5-star Osa Peninsula Costa Rica Retreat & Spa Retreat, which has been recognized as one of the leading eco-friendly destinations in Costa Rica. Camp Osa is a place where you can experience the magic of this country, where you will have plenty of time to unwind and discover yourself in one of the most beautiful places on earth.

The Eco-Retreats are all located inside the boundaries of Corcovado National Park, which means that you will have easy access to pristine forests and beaches.

This is exactly what makes the Osa Peninsula so special. It is home to an incredible variety of wildlife, including whales, dolphins, monkeys and endangered species such as the tapir and jaguar.

The area offers incredible biodiversity and unique ecosystems such as mangrove swamps and rainforests with giant trees like Mahogany and Ironwood trees.
