          Camp Osa Peninsula is a charming camp situated on a peninsula jutting out into the lake. It has a simple, rustic feel, with wooden cabins, each with two beds, mosquito netting and fans. There are also four family units with king-sized beds. The bathrooms are shared and have hot-water showers.

There’s a small restaurant on the premises that serves up three meals daily (breakfast/lunch/dinner). The food here isn’t particularly outstanding but you won’t go hungry.

Camp Osa Peninsula is about 1.5km north of Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí on the road to San Carlos.

This gorgeous place sits at the end of a rutted track, 10 minutes from Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí and surrounded by beautiful primary forest – an ideal spot to watch for wildlife from its shady terrace, which has hammocks and rocking chairs for lounging about in while sipping a glass of wine or beer (from US$3). Accommodation is in five comfortable rooms – including two with private decks – set around a pool with a stunning view of the rainforest canopy below, as well as a private zip line (US$15) that runs from one end of the property to another. Rates include all meals here too – you can't miss it as it's sitting right next door to its sister company Dúrika Agroturismo (%2519-2571; www.durikaagroturismo.com), which offers more economical packages if you want just accommodations without meals included (US$45 per person without bathroom).

This is a peaceful place located 12km down a rough road from Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí, where only guests are allowed past the gatehouse; this is great news for those who want to get away from everything and still be able to enjoy some creature comforts like hot water and electricity! Accommodation is in 11 wooden cabins (with fans), each sleeping four people and sharing two bathrooms with hot showers; there's also one unit with air-con and another that's wheelchair accessible (but it lacks hot water). Rates include all meals here too – there's also an excellent restaurant on the premises serving Costa Rican fare like rib eye steak (order ahead of time if you can!). It's worth noting that this place isn't suitable for those who have mobility issues or those traveling on foot as it's pretty far out there!
