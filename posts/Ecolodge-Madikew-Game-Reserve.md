          Ecolodge Madikew Game Reserve is a rural ecolodge in the heart of the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The lodge is a haven for nature lovers and birders, who can enjoy a relaxing break in a paradisiacal setting. Tucked away in the rolling hills of the Madikew Game Reserve, surrounded by pristine natural scenery, this secluded lodge offers peace and tranquility. The Madikew Game Reserve is part of the Fynbos Biome and boasts one of the largest populations of Red-Billed Queleas in South Africa. The lodges own private game reserve stretches over 400 hectares and includes indigenous bushveld, fynbos shrub land, grassland and floodplains providing habitat for prolific wildlife. Guests can enjoy game drives through these habitats with their expert ranger guides to spot animals such as bushbuck, zebra, eland, gemsbok (oryx), blesbok (oryx), kudu (oryx), duiker (antelope) and steenbok (antelope).

The lodges focus is on conservation; Madikew Game Reserve was established in 2003 to protect this species-rich ecosystem for future generations to come.
