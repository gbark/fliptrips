Ecolodge Madikew Game Reserve is a charming ecolodge that has 9 thatched cottages, each with private bathroom. They are very comfortable and beautifully decorated.

Madikwe Game Reserve is one of South Africa’s newest game reserves. It was created in 2000 by the WWF and Wilderness Safaris, to provide a home for the magnificent black rhino population that was being decimated by poachers. There are now over 800 rhinos living in Madikwe, making it the largest black rhino sanctuary in Africa.

Madikwe is also home to many other species of Southern African wildlife, including the Big Five – lion, leopard, buffalo, elephant and rhino – as well as cheetah, wild dog, giraffe and more than 400 bird species.

The landscape is stunning with rolling hills covered by bushveld trees and wildlife roaming freely across the plains. The reserve is surrounded by a 9km electric fence to prevent poachers from entering the area. This makes it much safer to walk around during game drives. There are seven different types of lodges within Madikwe Game Reserve: 3 Wilderness lodges (two of which are located inside Madikwe National Park) and 4 Wilderness tented camps (all located outside Madikwe National Park).
