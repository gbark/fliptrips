          Palace Cipriani is a upscale palace of a hotel on Venice’s Grand Canal. It was constructed in the late 19th century by a wealthy Italian wine merchant and is filled with rich mahogany and red velvet. The entire building is a work of art.

In addition to the opulence, the hotel’s restaurant, Harry’s Bar, is considered one of the best in Italy. It was established by Giuseppe Cipriani in 1931 and has been visited by some of the most famous people in history including Ernest Hemingway, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra and even Queen Elizabeth II.

The restaurant serves some of the best Bellini cocktails in town. Bellini’s are a cocktail made from white peaches and prosecco (a sparkling white wine). The Bellini was originally named after Venetian Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini because of his frequent use of peach tones in his paintings. However, it wasn’t until 1946 that Giuseppe Cipriani created Bellini cocktails for American actress Grace Kelly when she visited Venice during her honeymoon with Prince Rainier III on the royal yacht Liria. In Cipriani’s honor, we decided to visit Venice’s famous restaurant for some Bellinis and we were not disappointed!
