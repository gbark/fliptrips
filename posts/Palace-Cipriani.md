Palace Cipriani is a rustic palace located in the heart of Venice. The hotel was built in the 1800’s and it is now a 5 star hotel with a casino and a breathtaking restaurant (La Terrazza, rated as one of Italy’s best restaurants). You can also find shops, a swimming pool, a small casino and two meeting rooms.

Palace Cipriani is located just steps from Saint Mark’s Square and provides guests with great access to all there is to see and do in the historic center of Venice.

Palace Cipriani has been beautifully restored giving it a modern luxury feel while retaining all the charm of Venice.

There are only 16 suites at Palace Cipriani so you can rest assured that you will not be sharing your hotel room with 50 other people. Each room has a different theme, our room had a grand piano that doubled as the writing desk, I loved it! The bedroom also had an original fireplace that was converted into an electric fireplace which was fantastic for those chilly winter nights. We had to leave the window open as it was very cold but luckily we didn’t have any problems with noise as we were on the first floor.

The bathroom was beautiful with beautiful marble flooring and sinks. The bathtub was gorgeous but unfortunately we didn’t have time to use it! That is one thing I really miss when I go backpacking – hot showers! But I guess you will have to make time for them when staying at Palace Cipriani! We did enjoy breakfast every morning on their rooftop terrace which had 360 degree views of Venice – breathtaking!!! Breakfast was served until 11:00 am so if you wanted to sleep in you could all day long! The breakfast included fresh fruit platters, pastries, sausage and bacon (you could also order eggs) – all delicious!! There was also fresh coffee and orange juice available all day long! Oh yeah – we loved this place!!
