Ranch Rift Valley is a breathtaking ranch in the heart of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya.

The property, which is run by a professional team, offers tourists the chance to explore the spectacular surroundings by horseback riding, mountain biking, hiking, bird watching or simply relaxing in beautiful lodge accommodation.

The ranch is divided into two sections. The lower section is home to many different species of wildlife including zebra, ostrich and antelope among others. Guests who are particularly adventurous can go out on safari drives in open 4x4s or take a horseback safari through the scenic grassland. The upper section offers breathtaking views of Mt Kilimanjaro and Mt Meru with breathtaking views that will surely leave you breathless.

Guests can also enjoy a round of golf at one of Nairobiâ€™s premier golf clubs which is just 30 minutes away from the Ranch.
