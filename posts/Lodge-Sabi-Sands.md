In addition to our accommodation, we offer a range of activities including guided game drives with knowledgeable rangers from our sister company West Gate Conservancy. Whether you are looking for a luxurious getaway or a more adventurous adventure we have something to suit your needs.

Lodge Sabi Sands is situated in the centre of the famed Sabi Sand Game Reserve, which has been described as ‘the ultimate wildlife experience’ by National Geographic. The reserve is home to an incredible variety of animals that can be viewed during daily game drives or walks with expert guides from our sister company West Gate Conservancy.
