          Private Island Aqua Beach is a charming private island located on the south end of Seven Mile Beach on Grand Cayman. The island is located within the famous Little Cayman Beach Resort, an eco-resort that is home to many notable celebrities including Bill Gates, John Travolta, and Sting. Private Island Aqua Beach has a white sand beach with views of neighboring islands and the Caribbean Sea. The island is ideal for relaxing on the beach or enjoying some time in the water. There are no large resorts or high rise buildings on this island, allowing guests to enjoy a secluded getaway.

The beach itself is not very wide but does nicely accommodate for smaller groups of people, swimming and snorkeling around the island. There are some decent sized rocks at both ends of the island which can be used as diving platforms into deeper waters with better visibility. It takes only a few minutes to swim from one side of the island to another so it’s nice to have your own private slice of paradise without it being too over crowded with other people.

The water surrounding this private island is extremely calm due to its sheltered location, making it perfect for families with young children looking for a safe place to enjoy some beach time together or for snorkeling around this small private island. The ocean floor surrounding Private Island Aqua Beach is covered in coral heads which provide great hiding places for small fish that like to camouflage themselves among them. This makes it an amazing spot for snorkelers who want to explore some underwater caves and wildlife spotting opportunities while they’re at it.
