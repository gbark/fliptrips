Lodge Ocean Sunset is a spiritual lodge, located in the spectacular Daintree rainforest, one of Australia's most magnificent natural settings.

The lodge is located on the banks of the Daintree River, only minutes from the main entrance to the Daintree National Park. Here you will discover an ancient tropical rainforest, teeming with life and beauty. To preserve this environment, we offer a simple luxury style accommodation where visits to the park are included in your holiday.

We are dedicated to providing outstanding service and quality accommodation while supporting local communities and protecting our planet. We are located on Aboriginal land surrounded by the traditional lands of the Yidinji people. We are committed to ongoing consultation with these communities to ensure that our presence does not impact on their culture or environment in any way.
