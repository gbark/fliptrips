Inn Gritti Palace is a jawdropping inn that was built in the 1700s, and it’s been retained with its original furniture and decoration.

For a more modern design, check out the Grand Hotel Europe. It has a mix of contemporary and old-fashioned decor, and it perfectly blends in with the surrounding area of Castello.

If you’re looking for a 5-star hotel experience, check out the Bauer Il Palazzo. The hotel has two towers, and each one has its own character. It’s located right in front of Saint Mark’s Square, so you can get to all the major sights by foot easily.

Finally, if you want to stay in a mansion that doesn’t have any modern features at all, check out Palazzo Contarini Pola. This palace was built in 1567 and is rich with historical details like ancient frescoes and marble floors. The building is surrounded by Venetian gardens where you can enjoy your morning coffee or an evening drink while getting away from the hustle and bustle of city life that surrounds you in Venice. You can even take an afternoon dip in the pool that overlooks Saint Mark’s Square!
