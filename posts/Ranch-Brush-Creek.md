![Ranch Brush Creek](../../img/plains/pexels-antony-trivet-6053075.jpg)

Ranch Brush Creek is a charming ranch house located in the historic Rancho De Las Animas area. The design of this home is a high-end version of a wide-plank wood floor and a very contemporary western aesthetic.

The walls were left open to the living room, giving the home an airy feel with plenty of windows and views from every side. The kitchen itself is a nice mix of modern touches and rustic touches, which makes it feel very homey.

The large windows in the great room make it feel even larger, while also affording this home a lot of natural light. The black cabinets and white countertops give this kitchen a very clean look that is also easy to clean, something that is important for a busy family with small children.
