          Ranch Brush Creek is a rural ranch in the eastern part of the Texas Panhandle, located northeast of the city of Borger in Hutchinson County. The ranch is located in a bend of Brush Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Red River. It was established by Mose and Sarah Coe in 1910 and has been occupied continuously by members of their family (sometimes in combination with others) and other descendants since then. The ranch has been operated as a working ranch since its establishment, and it continues to be used for cattle raising and other agricultural activities.

The Coes built their first house on the property in 1910, but it burned down about 1914. After rebuilding, they covered both sides with white cement plaster. In 1920, they made an addition to the house for their son James "Jim" Coe Jr., who married Lois Tucker that year; this addition included a parlor and two bedrooms. Two years later, Jim Coe Sr. built a new house about west of his original residence so that James Jr.'s family would not have to move when he took over management of the ranch after his father's death in 1934. He joined his parents' house to this one with a breezeway between them; he also added a kitchen onto his parents' house at this time to accommodate his mother Sarah's needs after her husband's death. In 1940â€“41, Jim Jr.'s son Ben Coe added another bedroom onto his grandparents' house for his mother-in-law Maudie Tucker [an aunt-by-marriage] after her husband Honeysuckle died in 1940; she lived there until her death in 1967 at age 93.
