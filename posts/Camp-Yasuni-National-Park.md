Camp Yasuni National Park is a spiritual camp that is located at the place that is surrounded by an enormous amount of trees and other plants which are considered as the lungs of the earth. This place is very close to the Ecuadorian Rainforest. The name of this national park is given after a tribe that lives in this area. The camp was established by the people who believe in preserving nature and therefore has been helpful in conserving thousands acres of rainforest.

The camp offers you to participate in different activities like swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, hiking, biking, bird watching etc. You can also participate in several workshops that are organized by local community leaders. When you are participating in these activities you will be able to learn about the culture of indigenous people who live there.

You can even take your kids along with you or even your family because during your stay at this camp they will be able to explore their own potentials and talents through different activities which are available there. When you are planning for a trip to this camp it will be better if you take an expert guide with you because he or she will be able to explain everything about this region which can be really interesting for them. If kids want to go through jungle survival training they can join it as well since it is really awesome for them.
