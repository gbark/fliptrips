          Ranch Grosso is a spiritual ranch in the north of Argentina, with a strong focus on human growth and development. Its main purpose is to allow spiritual seekers to break free from the grip of the ego through practices such as meditation and Yoga in order to connect with their inner power and discover their true nature: God’s divine energy. Ranch Grosso is a place of miracles and joy, where people come for a week or two in order to heal their body and mind, and fill their hearts with love.

Ranch Grosso has been created by Myrna (a Yoga teacher) and Amor (a healer). They both had experienced severe suffering in their lives that had opened up an inner need for transformation. After many years of searching they found in India, at Sri Aurobindo’s ashram in Pondicherry, a powerful method to dissolve suffering by bringing it back to its source: the ego. They came back from India transformed forever by the experience they had gained there. So they decided to share it by creating a place of healing, growth and spirituality where people could reconnect with themselves again through practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, Yoga techniques aimed at dissolving suffering, etc…

The ranch has been established on the land of Amor’s Grandmother’s farm since 2005. It is located just two hours away from Buenos Aires city centre. There are five cabins on site all beautifully decorated with wooden floors, private bathrooms and hot showers. The kitchen is spacious with a large table where all guests can gather together for meals during breakfast time or dinner time (included in the price). The kitchen also has a fully equipped professional kitchen available for cooking classes or other activities that can be run on-site during your stay at Ranch Grosso. In addition there is an outdoor fire pit where guests gather around at night under the stars while listening to some great stories from Amor himself about his experiences around the world while helping women who were suffering from breast cancer or had been raped or abused during war times in places such as Afghanistan or Iraq…

The ranch also offers massages done by “the Healer” who uses ayurvedic oils infused with different herbs based on each guest’s need (individual sessions are charged separately). There are also Yoga classes given twice per day by Myrna herself either outside under huge avocado trees or inside one of three Yoga salons depending on weather conditions… All guest rooms have beautiful views over vast green fields surrounding Ranch Grosso which makes you feel connected with Nature directly… There is also an outdoor swimming pool that offers spectacular sunset views over Buenos Aires valley… It is truly amazing! You can even take long walks around the ranch grounds before dinner time under tall eucalyptus trees offering shade all day long…

Ranch Grosso offers many activities all year round depending on seasonal changes but mostly hosts workshops focused on self-discovery through meditation techniques aimed at helping participants learn how to deal with pain so it doesn’t stop them from being happy again… These workshops can last anywhere between 2 days up to 30 days depending on what your needs are based on your personal thoughts/feelings about this particular topic…
