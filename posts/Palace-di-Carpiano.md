          Palace di Carpiano is a sophisticated palace in Milan, northern Italy. It is located in Carpiano Street, n. 88, quarter of Porta Venezia, within the limits of the Parco di Monza e Brianza. The palace was built by architect Giuseppe Piermarini between 1792 and 1797 for count Gianantonio Dall'O & ndash; Azzoni. Located on top of Porta Venezia hill and near the royal residence of Porta Nuova (now known as Palazzo Reale), it offers a wide view over Milan and Lake Como.

The facade has a large porch supported by columns and two round towers joining above the main entrance; all these elements were added in 1846 by architect Luigi Clerici. The interior is richly decorated with stuccoes (1797â€“98) by Giuseppe Cristoforo Tencalla, frescoes (1803) by Francesco Folli and paintings (19th century) by Giuseppe Canella, Luigi Scrosati, Carlo Francesco Nuvolone and Giovanni Battista Castiglione. The piano nobile has a frescoed ceiling depicting Glory surrounded by putti and garlands painted in 1847 by Francesco Hayez for Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's visit to the palace. Several rooms still retain their original furnishings such as tapestries and furniture from the second half of the 18th century as well as some paintings from the 19th century including works by Giuseppe Bison, Pompeo Marchesi and Ermenegildo Costantini .
