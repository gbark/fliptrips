          Inn Mashpi is a ecological inn, offering an irresistible combination of ecological tourism, organic agriculture and spirituality in the Cordillera Blanca. The inn was established in 2004 by the local community with the aim of creating a place of learning and sharing for Peruvian and international travellers wishing to visit the area. Run with solar energy, organic vegetables are grown in its own gardens to provide food for the guests. The owners are also involved with raising alpacas.

The main house is built directly onto the rock face, incorporating stones from the original Inca trail, which is close at hand. Each room has stunning views of Mount Yerupajá (6668m) or Mount Chacraraju (5947m). It has a small library in English and Spanish with information on local walks and trails. There is also a small meditation centre near to the main house under a thatched roof supported by wooden poles. Guests may book one-day or two-day workshops on meditation or yoga, or longer courses on these subjects.

The rooms are all very different, but all have different features such as hammocks, beds made from local wood, windows with panoramic views of mountains or skylights for star gazing at night!

This elegant hotel, set among gardens overgrown with native flowers, has 10 rooms that are beautifully decorated with antiques-filled nooks and crannies that evoke colonial times without being ostentatious. Some rooms have Jacuzzis while others have fireplaces and there’s even one suite decorated entirely in red! There’s an excellent restaurant here too (dinner mains S40).

At this friendly hotel some rooms have fantastic views of Volcán Parón while others look onto pretty gardens where there’s a fountain and pathways made from stones collected from Inca ruins around town (hence its name ‘The People’s Heater’).
