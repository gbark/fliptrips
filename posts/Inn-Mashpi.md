Inn Mashpi is a isolated inn in the mountains in the south-east of Bolivia. It was built in 1932 by the Belgian missionary Père Jean-Pierre Dejairagre, who wanted to help improve living conditions for local people.

When Père Dejairagre died in 1964, he was buried at Mashpi under his favourite tree. His grave is marked by a simple cross that stands outside the chapel at Mashpi. Père Dejairagre is well remembered and his legacy lives on through the work of local people, who continue to run the inn to this day.
