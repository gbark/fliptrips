Hotel and Spa Cipriani is a rustic Hotel and Spa on the island of Giudecca, in Venice, Italy. It is located on the same island as the historic Palazzo Cipriani and next to the Giardini Pubblici, one of Venice's largest parks. Cipriani Hotel and Spa comprises a total of 73 rooms and suites spread over three historical palazzos. The first hotel was built by Giuseppe Cipriani (1872–1927) on his own family estate at Ca' Cipriani on Giudecca in 1914. The hotel was sold to Sheraton in 1966 and reopened as a Sheraton Hotel; it was closed again in 2001 and reopened as a hotel and spa by Harry's Bar proprietor Giuseppe Cipriani (1928–2011), grandson of the first owner.

The works carried out by the third generation have been able to fully restore all that was lost over time: to bring back life to its glorious past , using only authentic materials, following the path traced out by his grandfather Giuseppe Cipriani, who made his dreams come true with determination, passion and love for his country .
