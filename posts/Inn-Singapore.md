Inn Singapore is a charming inn with a great location, a very friendly staff and comfortable rooms. This is a gem of a find in Singapore, and one of our favorite places to stay.

Inn Singapore is located at 30 Victoria Street, near the mouth of the Singapore River. The hotel has a great location with excellent access to transportation, shopping, dining and attractions. The hotel is also close to the financial district and the Raffles Place MRT station so you can easily get around town.

The hotel offers free parking for guests arriving by car at the hotel’s lot or valet parking services for $25 per night (subject to availability). The hotel also has free WiFi access throughout the property.

The inn has 40 well-appointed guest rooms that are all equipped with air conditioning, cable television, tea / coffee making facilities, an electronic safe and several other amenities including hair dryers and showers with bathtubs. There are non-smoking rooms available as well as rooms with connecting doors for families traveling together (enquire when booking). Some of the rooms have balconies but if not there are shared balconies on each floor overlooking Victoria Street that guests may use freely. The shared balconies are perfect for enjoying an evening cocktail or playing cards with friends! Check out these photos of some of Inn Singapore’s rooms:
