Camp Madikew Game Reserve is a private camp located in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The accommodation is within canvas tents with thatched roofs and verandas, looking out over the floodplains beyond.

The private camp is part of the Madikew community, who have lived in this region for generations. Although there are no permanent buildings, the Madikew people have worked with Nature of Africa to create a camp that fits with their traditional way of life. Nature of Africaâ€™s staff visit the Madikew regularly to ensure that they are fully involved in all aspects of the daily running of the camp; including setting up and taking down, running activities and maintaining wildlife fences used to protect game during flood season.
