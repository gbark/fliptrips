          Camp Madikew Game Reserve is a rustic camp situated on the banks of the Sabie River, in the Madikew Nature Reserve. The camp consists of five platform tents, each with a private bathroom. It is a paradise for all those who love to explore the wild.

Madikew Game Reserve is located along an old wagon track that links the Kruger Park to the Timbavati Wildlife Reserve. This old wagon track is now known as “The Great Wagon Road”. It has been declared a National Monument by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA). The road is listed as one of South Africa's most important cultural heritage sites.

Activities include game drives, bush walks and cultural tours at Madikew village.
