Hotel Ocean View is a spiritual hotel. The architecture is pure Zen. It is very beautiful and comfortable.

The hotel has a big garden with a meditation center, where you can learn Yoga and meditate every day.

They serve different kinds of food all day long, but it is not a vegetarian hotel. You can be vegetarian only if you ask for it. They have a lot of vegetarian options, but they donâ€™t promote this diet, they just serve what you order.

Tourists from all over the world come to the hotel to practice yoga and meditation for a week or two before going back to their country or city. People love this place because it has the perfect environment to do their practices, and eat well too!

I stayed at Hotel Ocean View for 7 days and I loved it! This place is very relaxing and peaceful. Perfect for those who want to rest deeply and slow down before going back to their stressful lives in cities or countries far away from India.
