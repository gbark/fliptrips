          Ecolodge Paracas is a isolated ecolodge, located in the heart of the Paracas National Reserve. It is situated on a peninsula with ocean views on one side, and the Paracas National Reserve on the other. The lodge has 22 individual bungalows and 2 suites, each one completely surrounded by its own garden. All bungalows and suites have private terraces with magnificent views over the ocean and Paracas Bay.

The lodge is an ecological lodge which aims to preserve the environment and wildlife by recycling water, producing zero waste and even using solar energy as much as possible. The owners also run a turtle conservation project which was started in 2006 to protect this endangered species along the Peruvian coast.

The name of this lodge is taken from a small species of sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, which is only found here in Peru and Chile (hence the scientific name).
