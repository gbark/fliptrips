Ecolodge Paracas is a breathtaking ecolodge that sits on a hill behind the Paracas National Reserve. It is a very special place that has been created by the Peruvian natives and the owners of Ecolodge Paracas, Romina and Pablo Campuzano.

The vision of the Campuzano family is to create a sustainable eco retreat that offers its guest a unique opportunity to explore and experience nature in all its glory. The choice of location, the design of the ecolodge, and all of its facilities has been done with this goal in mind.

The ecolodge is situated at around 800 meters above sea level with stunning views over the Pacific Ocean and coastline. The location also offers fantastic views over two neighboring mountain ranges; one is known as Cerro Colorado (the red mountain) and Cerro Paracas (the Paracas mountain). From this vantage point you can observe sea lions, marine iguanas, flamingos, birds and much more as they inhabit these protected beaches.
