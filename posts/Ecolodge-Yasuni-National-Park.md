          Ecolodge Yasuni National Park is a breathtaking ecolodge, located just 15 minutes from the world famous Yasuni National Park. Built on an old oil camp, the lodge is the ideal place to enjoy nature, wildlife, and relax in a beautiful rainforest setting.

The lodge is on the banks of the Tiputini River and offers some of the best river views in Yasuni. Our guide will take you to explore the nearby trails taking you through primary forest on your way to visit a tribal community.

We are totally off-grid, which means that we are not connected to any power grids or water pumps, which keeps us away from pollution. We use solar panels for electricity and gravity powered pumps for our showers!
