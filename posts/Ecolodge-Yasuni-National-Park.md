Ecolodge Yasuni National Park is a rustic ecolodge located in the heart of the Yasuni National Park, Ecuador. The lodge is surrounded by primary rainforest and is only accessible by boat.

The lodge was built with local materials and is powered by solar panels and a small wind turbine. It has 2 double rooms and 2 suites, which sleep between 3-5 people each. It has a large deck and dining area overlooking the river and forest, as well as a smaller deck located above the kitchen with views to the forest canopy.

It is one of only two lodges in the Yasun√≠ National Park; we visited both, we liked this one much better than Tinkuy Ecolodge because it felt more remote (although they are both located inside the national park), had better food (the chef at Tinkuy was not very good) and because there were more activities available (for example Kayaking).

Tours can be booked through either lodge; we used Viveros Ecoturisticos for our tour to Tiwai Island.
