          Ecolodge San Ignacio is a pristene ecolodge, located in the eastern part of the earth's largest rainforest. The lodge is nestled in the middle of pristine nature and offers you a unique experience, as well as opportunities to encounter rare wildlife.

The lodge is situated on the border of the Maya Biosphere Reserve and can be reached after a 3 hour drive from Belize City, the capital of Belize. During this drive you will pass through several villages and experience all that Belize has to offer. After an approx. 1 hour boat-ride you will arrive at the lodge, where we will greet you with a welcome drink and a tour around the lodge to make sure that everything is to your liking. After checking-in you will have plenty of time to relax or explore before dinner is served at 7:00pm.

The following day we will show you around our Ecolodge and take you for a boat ride down our lagoon, where we have 2 types of native Belizean wildlife: crocodiles and manatees. You may also choose to go on an excursion into our rainforest, where you can learn more about its flora and fauna through a guided walk by one of our local guides. In addition, we can arrange for other activities such as horseback riding or cave tubing etc..
