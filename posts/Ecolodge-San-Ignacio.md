Ecolodge San Ignacio is a magical ecolodge nestled in the jungle on the skirts of San Ignacio. The lodge is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of busy city life and enjoy nature at its best.

The lodge is located on a large piece of land that includes an incredible swimming pool, a pool table, 2 restaurants/bars, hammocks and lounge chairs to relax in. The staff at the lodge are very friendly and nice! We booked our tours with them and they were very helpful with planning what we wanted to do during our stay.

The rooms are very nice and clean. They have everything you need in the room, including a fridge for drinks, coffee maker, soap/shampoo/conditioner in a dispenser in each bathroom, towels and even toilet paper! The beds are very comfortable with mosquito nets over them so if you have any kind of insects in your room you can just close your net over you when you sleep at night! Each room has a terrace overlooking the beautiful grounds or jungle.

We stayed in an ‚ÄúEco‚Äù room which is located near the restaurant/bar area so we could watch TV when we wanted to but also be close if we wanted to go out for dinner or drinks. It is also away from most of the noise that happens by the pool/bar area during the day‚Ä¶ perfect for napping! If that doesn‚Äôt work for you there are several other types of rooms available including suites with private plunge pools if that‚Äôs what you want!

The food at Ecolodge San Ignacio was delicious!!! They have 2 restaurants on-site which serve breakfast (included) every morning from 8am-10am with lots of options from pancakes, omelets, breads, juices etc. Lunch is served from 12pm-2pm again with lots of options like chicken or fish dishes as well as salads or rice dishes etc., all delicious! Dinner was served between 7pm-10pm again with lots of different options like chili con carne (beef stew), chicken curry (YUMMY), shrimp fajitas etc‚Ä¶ Everything was delicious!!! There is also popcorn available 24 hours a day if you get hungry between meals or want to snack before bedtime‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay here they don‚Äôt mind!! üôÇ I can not say enough about how tasty everything was!!
