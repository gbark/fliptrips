Lodge Naladhu is a upscale lodge situated in the heart of Kumana National Park, Sri Lanka. It is a wildlife sanctuary with a variety of wildlife including an elephant population.

Kumana National park has the largest population of elephants in Sri Lanka. The elephants are featured in the logo of the lodge. Kumana National Park is home to a wide range of animals including leopards, wild buffaloes, deer, Nilgiri langurs and many varieties of birds.

Kumana National Park was established in 1975 under the Wildlife Ordinance No. 31 of 1972 to protect this unique ecosystem. The park is accessible via Oluvil Beach on the southern coast, approximately 50 kilometres from Matara town. There are two entrances to the park - one via Oluvil and another via Udawalawe.
