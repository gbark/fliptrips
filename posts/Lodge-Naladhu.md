          Lodge Naladhu is a isolated lodge in the middle of the jungle. You have to walk for 30 min through the forest to reach there.

It is located in a pristine rainforest, 2 hours away from Bandarawela and 3 hours from Haputale. The lodge is simple but comfortable with 9 rooms.

The rooms have a private bathroom, hot water, electric light and a terrace with a hammock to relax at night after a hard day. The view from the rooms is amazing through a window facing a small rice field and the other, on the other side, there is nothing but jungle.

Lodge Naladhu has no restaurant or room service so you have to bring food with you or ask for cooking local food for you by the owner Mrs. Dinesh who will prepare everything traditional Sri Lanka style with fresh products from her farm. We ordered chicken curry and vegetable curry and they were delicious!
