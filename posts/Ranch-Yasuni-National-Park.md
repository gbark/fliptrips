          Ranch Yasuni National Park is a pristene ranch that has been turned into a small national park. It is part of Ecuador’s larger efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest. Local guides take you on a hike through the forest, explaining how it has been left in its natural state after years of ranching.

While this particular national park is not well known, it is stunningly beautiful and well worth visiting. The tour even includes a naturalist guide who explains the history and ecology of the area.

16 Península de Paracas National Reserve Peru

Something that many people do not realize about Peruvian beaches is that they are often found in national reserves and protected areas where visitors can enjoy them freely in a pristine setting. The Península de Paracas National Reserve is one such place and one of the best in all of South America.

The reserve includes 9 km (5 mi) of beach and gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean, as well as desert, mountains, and lagoons. It is also home to an incredible amount of wildlife such as whales, marine turtles, seabirds (especially flamingos), sea lions, dolphins, and more! Even if you’re not into nature or scuba diving or snorkeling (which you should be!), this place is still worth visiting for the stunning views alone!
