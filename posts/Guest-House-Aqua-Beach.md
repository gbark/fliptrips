Guest House Aqua Beach is a upscale guest house located in a very safe and private neighborhood of Nungwi, Zanzibar. We offer amazing rooms with ensuite bathrooms, 2 minutes from the beach. Our restaurant serves seafood and Indian cuisine.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, they can help us organize any excursion, advise on local activities or simply make us feel at home. The villa has a large pool surrounded by palm trees and a bar where you can relax after a day in the sun.
