          Lodge Osa Peninsula is a jawdropping lodge where guests can experience the real Costa Rica. It’s the perfect place to stay if you want to experience nature at its best and meet the locals.

It offers a range of activities including rafting, horseback riding and hiking, as well as a yoga platform and a massage hut.

The lodge is designed with local architecture and features four-poster beds and enormous bay windows overlooking the Osa Peninsula and Pacific Ocean.

There are two restaurants at the lodge, one that serves fresh seafood caught from the Pacific Ocean and another that specializes in wood-fired pizza. Both overlook the jungle canopy.

“The environment around us was just breathtaking,” said guest Grace Chiang. “The service was top notch – I can’t say enough good things about this hotel – it was magical!”
