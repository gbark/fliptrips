Lodge Grosso is a jawdropping lodge set in the cloud forest of the Manu Biosphere Reserve, in the pristine Amazon. The lodge was designed by renowned architect Guy Holleran, who designed many of Peru’s most luxurious hotels. Every room has a private balcony with an expansive view of the surrounding jungle.

The lodge covers 25,000 square meters and has 9 buildings, including a restaurant, bar, swimming pool, spa and even a hair salon. It also has its own airstrip for direct flights from Cusco or Lima.

The rooms are sumptuous with elegant furnishings imported from Europe and artwork reflecting the surrounding forest life. The rooms are spacious over 100 square meters each with two queen-sized beds and include views of either the jungle or river below.

Lodge Grosso was named one of the world’s top 10 hotels by Condé Nast Traveler in 2013 and one of the top 25 hotels in South America by Travel & Leisure Magazine in 2012.
