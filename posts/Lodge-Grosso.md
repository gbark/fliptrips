          Lodge Grosso is a breathtaking lodge situated right on the banks of the Rio Negro. The lodge is part of a sustainable tourism project and many of the workers live on site and are involved in the daily care and maintenance of the lodge and surrounding area. At night, hundreds of fireflies light up the forest around this beautiful lodge.



The spacious thatched roof cabins have private bathrooms with hot showers, king size beds with mosquito netting, living areas with hammocks, and verandas overlooking the river. Every cabin has a private wooden decked area for viewing birds and other wildlife as well as an outdoor shower with hot water.



The dining room is open to the forest at both ends where you can view birds through two long glass windows that also give you an opportunity to watch monkeys playing in the trees around the dining room. There are tables inside for those who prefer air conditioning or fans to keep you cool when it's hot outside.



The lodge's lounge is an open air structure with comfortable seating, hammocks, wood burning stoves, local artwork made by native artisans, books about this area of Brazil, photos of local flora & fauna, information about what to do around this area during your stay at this wonderful lodge.



This is a truly magical place to stay! Stroll through the forest along nature trails leading to hummingbird feeders or sit on your cabin porch listening to howler monkeys calling out across the river. Wake up with a morning walk through lush tropical forest with birds chirping all around you - truly an experience you won't forget!
