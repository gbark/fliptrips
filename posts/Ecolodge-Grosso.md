          Ecolodge Grosso is a rustic ecolodge, ecologically responsible, offering visitors the chance to connect with nature while enjoying the comforts of home. We are located in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, on the banks of an Amazon tributary river. All rooms are very spacious, with private bathrooms and ceiling fans. There is plenty of space to walk around and enjoy the spectacular scenery of the rainforest. The river flows right in front of our lodge. We offer lots of activities for our guests: fishing, kayaking, hiking and bird watching. We have a natural pool on site, where you can relax after a day outside or while waiting for dinner to be prepared by our cook. Also on site is our own research station where scientists work daily to learn more about ecosystems in this region and also global warming effects on tropical forests through tree-ring analysis.

Ecolodge Grosso is located in an area that used to be inhabited by indigenous tribes called Cintas Largas and Tapirapé before they were brutally exterminated by European settlers in the 19th century. It also used to be a popular spot for rubber tappers in search for latex from local trees mixed with Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree), which was later replaced by the soya bean when Brazil lost its market share due to cheaper Asian countries that started producing rubber tree latex in bigger volumes at lower prices than Brazil was able to sell it at that time. This area has been under constant threat from loggers since then but due to its remoteness it remained untouched until recently when large areas surrounding us have been deforested by logging companies without any regard for conservation laws or environmental impact studies nor replanting programmes previously agreed upon with local communities or government agencies. Nowadays this area is under constant threat from illegal loggers who continue destroying valuable forests for short term gain without considering long term consequences. Although Ecolodge Grosso is not directly affected by deforestation we do suffer indirectly due to changes in weather patterns caused by deforestation activity further upstream along rivers such as Rio Negro and Solimões (Amazon). These rivers mark the borders between Peru and Brazil thus making them international waters subject to treaties between both countries regarding their use and protection but unfortunately these treaties are not being obeyed either due to corruption or lack of political will from either side resulting in devastating environmental impacts especially on fragile ecosystems such as ours here at Ecolodge Grosso
