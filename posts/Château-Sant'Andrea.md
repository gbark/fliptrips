          Château Sant'Andrea is a sophisticated château built in the late 19th century in the town of Poggio a Caiano, overlooking the valley of the River Arno.

Local tradition has it that a castle existed on the site from at least 473 AD, when King Hilderich gave it to Bishop Vincentius. However, there is little evidence for this claim. The medieval castle was destroyed in 1437 by Niccolò Fortebraccio. In 1548, the town became a fiefdom of Francesco I de' Medici and stayed with his family until 1658 when Cosimo III de' Medici sold it to the Chiaramonte family from Livorno. In 1777, Niccolò Gherardini bought Sant'Andrea and commissioned a major renovation by architect Giuseppe Manni with assistance from members of the famous Tuscan firm, including Giuseppe Antonio Lazzarini and Giovanni Battista Foggini. 

The château has been carefully renovated with careful attention to retain its historical flavor with elegant furnishings and antiques combined with modern conveniences such as air conditioning and satellite television. The gardens were designed by Achille Duchêne who also designed those at Villa Taranto-Rangoni near Lucca.
