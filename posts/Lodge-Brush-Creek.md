          Lodge Brush Creek is a isolated lodge in a beautiful setting. The location is the attraction. If you want a rustic cabin in a beautiful setting, this is the place for you.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the tight parking area. Two cars can barely fit in there. Also, due to the remote location, it is very dark at night and very hard to see well.
