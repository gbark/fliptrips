Resort St. Barts is a jawdropping resort in the Ritz Carlton hotel chain. Located in Gustavia, it is surrounded by one of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean. The view from the rooms—which start at $995 a night—is amazing.

2. La Reserve de Beaulieu (near Nice, France)

La Reserve de Beaulieu is a beautiful, secluded ski village in France that has managed to avoid the touristy feel that other French ski resorts have. It has its own ski school and slopes, and it's just an hour and a half from Nice. The hotel is also very family friendly and has great amenities like a pool and spa to help you relax after a long day on the slopes. It even offers babysitting services for parents who want to spend some time alone or with other adults during their stay.

3. Grand Hotel Tremezzo (on Lake Como)

Grand Hotel Tremezzo is located on gorgeous Lake Como in Italy and was built in 1829 by the English politician Earl of Shrewsbury for his wife, Henrietta Lambart, who was nicknamed "la bella Londinese" ("the beautiful Londoner"). This hotel oozes old-world classiness with its fine dining room overlooking Lake Como, amazing views of Bellagio across the lake, an impressive wine cellar with over 80 labels of wine, and stunning rooms that are all named after opera characters like Aida or Madame Butterfly.
