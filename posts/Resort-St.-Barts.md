          Resort St. Barts is a upscale resort that is located directly on the beach. The resort has a beautiful pool area that is surrounded by palm trees. The pool is lined with lounge chairs but no umbrellas are provided. There are plenty of shaded areas around the pool, however, because of the proximity to the ocean. The resort also has a spa and fitness center located at the far end of the resort away from the main pool area. If you would like to visit either location, you will need to walk through half of the resort to get there.

The room we stayed in was located in building #2 which was on one of the higher floors with an ocean front view. Since there were many high rises in close proximity to our room, we did not have any ocean views but could still hear waves crashing against the shoreline. The room itself overlooked another building where people were frequently smoking cigarettes and marijuana so it was definitely annoying at times when you couldnâ€™t step outside without smelling it!

The room was modern and very clean however it felt quite small because of all the furniture that was placed in it (especially in comparison to other hotels that we have stayed at). Our room had a king bed that could be separated into 2 twins, which I never saw before! There were also two full size couches (which were kind of pointless because they werenâ€™t comfortable), a desk, flat screen TV & DVD player, coffee table with 2 chairs and 2 large dressers with enough drawers for all your clothes/suitcases/etc. None of these pieces could be moved around so they took up quite a bit of space in our already small room! These types of rooms can be great when traveling with a larger family or group however if traveling with only 2 people I would look for a different type/size of room instead!

We had an amazing view from our balcony looking over some palm trees towards many highrises along Ocean Drive so we didnâ€™t spend too much time out there anyways! We did get some nice pictures though while sitting on one side of our patio furniture out on our balcony! We also had a full size outdoor jacuzzi tub on one side of our balcony which required us to walk over an air conditioning unit just get into it! Definitely not my idea or liking but I would have been fine if they wouldnâ€™t have put something there since we didnâ€™t use it at all anyways! Our shower was very small without any hooks or shelves inside for your toiletries or anything else you needed which was inconvenient considering space within this hotel is limited enough already! However the bathroom itself was clean and modern looking which always makes up for less space in my opinion!!! ðŸ˜‰

Resort St Barts is relatively new so everything seems very new and modern here including their outdoor spaces as well!! There are many places for you to enjoy either al fresco dining or simply walking around outside walking from your building to another without having to go outside onto Ocean Drive so this place definitely works well no matter what your preference might be!!! One thing I must say about this hotel is how comfortable their beds were!!!! They were sooo cozy and plushy it felt like sleeping on clouds!! We slept like babies every night we stayed here!!! It also seemed like most people working here speak English everywhere except at their restaurants which made things more difficult than they needed to be but otherwise everything seemed pretty good hereâ€¦if you love being right next door to all those hotels though then donâ€™t forget about smoking second hand smoke when enjoying dinner outside!! ðŸ˜³
