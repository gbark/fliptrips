          Hotel Marylebone is a upscale hotel in London that is located in a very nice, safe and central area. The staff is excellent and very helpful. I was able to get a junior suite with a king bed for about $150 a night, but the normal room prices are more expensive.



The hotel itself is quite small but well decorated and comfortable. Check-in / out was fast and easy, the room was large and had a lovely view of the street below. But above all, I loved how clean it was! This hotel rooms are much cleaner than other places I've been to in Europe (especially hostels). The food at the restaurant in the lobby is good too!



My only complaint is that the walls are very thin and you can hear everything going on in your neighbors' room if they're loud enough. Also, there's no free Wi-Fi provided unless you're paying for it, which I think is ridiculous since most other hotels provide it for free (even though you have to pay to use it).



But overall this hotel has great service and if you don't mind spending $150+ per night for a luxury experience then you should be happy at Hotel Marylebone!
