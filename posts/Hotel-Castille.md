Stay safe [ edit ]

Chiang Mai has its share of scams but they are not as rampant as they used to be. Many locals advise against carrying valuables in a bag after dark as one common scam involves bicycle thieves: A thief will ride by you and snatch your bag which is rigged with an alarm device (even though it wouldn't be heard if you were wearing earplugs). When it snatches your bag it will quickly switch off so that you cannot even hear it anymore, making people think that nothing happened. It is also advised that you do not carry your bags on your front side when walking down a dark street at night past bar-filled alleyways where thieves could easily snatch them from your hands without noticing you in advance. Besides bicycle theft there are other more sophisticated scams such as counterfeiting currencies from ATM machines using a "skimmer" device installed in some ATMs which are able to read bank cards' magnetic strips remotely which allows criminals to make copies of them allowing them to withdraw money from any ATM machine they wish without needing your PIN number or even having physical possession of your card during what seems like an ordinary transaction while you are unaware until days later when you get an unexpected call from local police who tell you that there are charges made on your bank account which you had no idea were made due to somebody tampering with ATM machines using these skimmers or placing skimmer devices inside ATMs where they record the information stored on the magnetic strip on your bank card including pin number while taking advantage of some technical flaw in their programming so they appear authentic when being used while later copying said data onto new blank cards allowing these scammers who use these "skimmers" or hackers who place them inside empty ATMs after hours so they can collect said data undetected before placing their bogus cards back inside afterwards so they can record pin numbers again while unsuspecting customers would insert their own cards into these infected ATMs not knowing what had just happened until days later when police contact them about fraudulent purchases made on their bank account which was compromised due to skimmers being placed inside various ATMs around town by organized crime gangs who know how exactly how these programs work knowing exactly how many characters must be entered for this type of transaction in order for stolen money withdrawn from another person's account through this type of transaction would be deposited into yours instead probably through some kind of error notification appearing during some kind of security update forced upon customers recently released by your bank where transactions involving more than 3 digits must be entered resulting in these scammers recording 4 digit numbers instead specifically designed for making people think that nothing happened when they enter only 3 digits thus avoiding raising suspicion when withdrawing larger amounts of money when entering fewer digits than required especially since most people using ATM machines usually only enter 2 digits when withdrawing amounts less than 100 baht thinking nothing about it since most people assume if nobody uses more than 2 digits then why should anyone use 4? Due to this most people do not notice anything wrong until days later after finding out via phone calls by phone companies informing them about large sums being withdrawn under their name with no pin number involved especially after leaving town for weeks or even months unaware that someone else has been withdrawing cash under their name using fake cards created using stolen personal information taken either directly from corrupt employees working for these phone companies who have direct access via computer systems containing personal information about customers especially cell phone account holders possibly due to weak security measures taken thus allowing access into sensitive areas without having proper security clearance leading employees into accessing databases containing personal information regarding other customers possibly due to lackadaisical attitudes regarding responsibility towards job requiring direct access into sensitive information possibly because those responsible were hired because those responsible were friends with those responsible for hiring those responsible thus nobody was doing their jobs properly thus leading hackers taking advantage by stealing names either online or offline then hacking computer systems containing sensitive data belonging not only themselves but other people as well so this problem has been going on since computers have been invented because nobody takes any real precautions against hackers stealing personal data belonging not only themselves but other people so this problem could have been avoided if databases containing sensitive data belonging not only themselves but other people could have been kept offline instead online where hackers could never get at them unless someone physically hacked into servers containing said databases physically removing hard drives storing said databases removing flash drives storing said databases removing memory sticks storing said databases removing micro SD cards storing said databases removing SIM cards storing said databases removing USB sticks storing said databases locating places within servers containing backup files containing backups containing backups containing
