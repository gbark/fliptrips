          Inn St Paul's is a sophisticated inn with a great location, built in 1844 as a private residence for a wealthy merchant. Today, the inn is managed by the same family, and still retains many of its original features â€“ including a grand staircase and a massive stone fireplace â€“ while offering modern amenities such as airy guest rooms.
