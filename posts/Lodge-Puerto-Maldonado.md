Lodge Puerto Maldonado is a breathtaking lodge set in the heart of the Madre de Dios region. The lodge is surrounded by an immense amount of wildlife and its aerial view allows you to spot animals from a distance. The lodge is located 100km from Cuzco and is situated in the town of Puerto Maldonado, which has an international airport. This lodge provides comfortable accommodations and delicious meals.

The lodge’s team offers their guests a unique experience that allows you to discover different parts of Peru and its rich culture. Some of their activities include: night floats, bird watching, excellent fishing, hiking and horseback riding. Their staff will help you plan out your trip and provide you with all the necessary information about your stay at Puerto Maldonado. The staff was very professional and knowledgeable about the area, wildlife and culture. They happily answered all my questions and provided great service throughout my stay.

I truly enjoyed my stay at Lodge Puerto Maldonado because it allowed me to explore a beautiful part of Peru while also supporting a local community by visiting local villages in the area to participate in their daily activities including cooking classes, visiting a school in one of the villages or even going on a mat weaving class with local women or learning how to create a songbird feeder out of a gourd bowl! I would recommend this place if you want to take it easy after your Inca Trail experience!
