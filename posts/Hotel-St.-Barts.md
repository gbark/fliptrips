          Hotel St. Barts is a stylish hotel where you’ll feel like a star. It’s a boutique hotel with a relaxed atmosphere and service that is impeccable. From the minute you walk in, you’ll feel welcome and special. You will be greeted by a beautiful woman who will welcome you warmly.

The staff will make you feel at home from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave. The rooms are well appointed, clean and comfortable. Every night, the staff puts out hors d’oevres and a lovely wine selection to enjoy in their stunning garden oasis. There is also a great rooftop bar to enjoy in the evening or early morning before heading out for an island adventure. The breakfast buffet was delicious with an array of fresh fruit, yogurt, breads and pastries to choose from as well as made-to-order egg dishes to order.

The hotel is located just steps from Orient Beach so it is close but not too close! I can easily recommend Hotel St Barts for anyone looking for a relaxing vacation in paradise!
