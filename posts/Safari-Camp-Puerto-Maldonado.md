          Safari Camp Puerto Maldonado is a jawdropping safari camp in the rainforest of Madre de Dios, featuring an amazing stretch of river and a private stretch of beach.

For our Peru: Inca Trail and Machu Picchu tours we use this camp as our basecamp for 4 nights after the trek finishing at Aguas Calientes. The camp is just a 15 minute boat ride from the town of Puerto Maldonado and is very well set up to receive such a large group such as ours.

The campsite itself is stunning. It has a private beach, which is beautiful but unfortunately it has been taken over by the local monkeys! There are also two swimming pools, both with swim platforms and canoes to paddle out to a small island in the middle which you can jump off if you dare! The main restaurant area has a bar where you can relax with a cocktail or cold beer, outside seating with hammocks and great views over the river.

The real highlight of this location though is not actually on site but downriver only about 5 minutes away by boat. That’s right – you get your own 90m stretch of river to yourself! We were fortunate enough to have it all to ourselves, which made for some great fishing – even catching piranhas! There’s also a small island further downriver that’s perfect for a picnic, jumping off cliffs into deep water or even doing some snorkelling – watch out for the crocodiles though! One evening we took part in an organised night walk along this bank too – definitely worth taking part in.
