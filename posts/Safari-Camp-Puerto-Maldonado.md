Safari Camp Puerto Maldonado is a rustic safari camp in the Madre de Dios region of Peru, near the Tambopata River, a major tributary of the Amazon River.

While a stay in a tent may not be your idea of luxury, it is a unique way to experience the jungle. By staying at Safari Camp Puerto Maldonado, you’ll get up close and personal with nature in a way that’s impossible in any other way.

At Safari Camp Puerto Maldonado you can enjoy an exciting morning breakfast walk through the jungle, wildlife viewing from your hammock during lunch and dinner walks by torchlight to observe night sounds and animals. During off-hours you can enjoy an amazing variety of activities including fishing, kayaking or exploring nearby lagoons by canoe in search for caiman and other species in their natural habitat.

Safari Camp Puerto Maldonado is located 4 hours from Cusco and 3 hours from Madre de Dios capital Puerto Maldonado.
