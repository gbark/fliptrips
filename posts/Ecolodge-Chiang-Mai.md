MARKETS


Night Bazaar (Offline map) is the best place to go for souvenirs; it’s filled with touristy stuff but also has some good buys for those who don’t like to haggle too much over prices. It runs parallel to Th Tha Phae (with plenty of connecting alleys) between Th Ratchadamnoen Nok & Th Ratchaphakhinai; there are also several other night bazaars scattered around town – see Click here .

Somphet Market Offline map Google map (cnr Th Charoen Prathet & Soi 1; 8am-8pm) This covered market is especially good for traditional Thai crafts such as textiles, woodcarvings, hill-tribe items, ceramics, baskets etc. It’s usually called Sunday Market because it opens every day except Sunday.


PICKING YOUR PAD


Chiang Mai has accommodation options to suit every budget – from simple bungalows to five-star resorts – but it remains true that you get what you pay for here. There are also so many places to stay that it can be hard to narrow things down, so here are a few pointers:


Old City


One of the most popular neighbourhoods for travellers due to its location within walking distance of many sights and close proximity to Chiang Mai University (and thus cheap student guesthouses). During the day this area is overrun with motorbikes speeding up Chang Klan Rd towards Doi Suthep; at night it gets quiet but you may hear music coming from bars on Moon Muang Rd.


Eastside


The east side of town is home to the city’s most exclusive hotels as well as some beautiful old teak shophouses occupied by trendy boutique hotels or restaurants. For those seeking seclusion without breaking the bank, there are some good midranger guesthouses just off Nimmanhemin Rd which provide plenty of peace without sacrificing too much convenience or atmosphere.


Southside


Another popular choice due to its convenient location near the airport bus terminal (approximately 10km south), Chiang Mai University (8km south), Central Airport Plaza shopping centre (8km south) and Wat Phra Singh temple (6km east). This area gets relatively busy during daylight hours so can be noisy at night when motorbikes speed between Soi 1 & 3 toward Th Na Meuang Mochit before turning north onto Ratwithi Rd at Wat Gate leading back downtown via Soi 2 & 3 or east onto Chang Klan Rd towards Doi Suthep. The south side also has quite a few expats living there which means more Western restaurants than elsewhere in town; however this translates into higher prices for food too! The main tourist strips running east−west along Charoenrat Rd include: Soi 4 , near Wat Gate; Soi 2 , which runs parallel behind Wat Gate; Soi 3 , which runs parallel behind Wat Gate; Soi 9 , which runs parallel behind Wat Gate; Soi 7 , which runs parallel behind Wat Gate; Soi 1 , where easy access via taxi makes it popular with drivers who live nearby or want a quick ride back downtown after work rather than having to take a whole circuitous route around town via the bypass road ; and Nimmanhemin Rd , a long strip running roughly west−east along the southern edge of campus with many nice cafes along its entire length plus numerous high end hotels lining both sides of Huay Kaew Rd .


Northside


A lot quieter than other parts of town because most visitors head straight into downtown after arriving at Chiang Mai International Airport via AIS Airport Service Express Bus Terminal . In addition there aren’t many attractions nearby apart from Nimmanhaemin Rd ; however this doesn’t mean things have been left completely neglected by tourism because all along Huay Kaew Rd you can find lots of cute cafés offering wi-fi internet service. A few places offer free wi-fi service including Apple Pie Cafe Offline map Google map( Nimmanhaemin/Huay Kaew Rd) ; Wateena Café Offline map Google map( 15/4 Nimmanhaemin/Huay Kaew Rd) ; Tea Tree Café Offline map Google map( 51/1 Nimmanhaemin/Huay Kaew Rd) ; Tawan Guesthouse Offline map Google map( 08 1763 1378; www.thailandhostelzguideblogcom 08 1763 1378; 15/1W Fang Payom Kangmuang Khwaeng Khun Yuam Chiang Mai 50100) and Roast Coffee House Offline map Google map( 33 Nimmanhaemin/Huay Kaew Rd) . If you want internet access away from these cafés then head over to Bluedragon Internet Cafe Offline map Google map( 0 5326 1221; 22 Khunlumprapas Lane 5 Nong Hoi 5 Alley Khunlumprapas Lane 5 Nong Hoiphan Neighbourhood unit 2 unit 2 530005032171020405030131Nonghoihai@yahoo com 250B per hour ) . It offers fast connections and reasonable prices but only opens during business hours so isn’t useful if you need access at odd hours such as early morning or late at night . There is another branch next door called Siam Internet Cafe that charges slightly higher fees but stays open 24 hours if needed . Both can help set up internet connections if needed . Another northside option worth mentioning is Herbal Sauna & Massage Center Offline map Google map( 0 5327 5052; 26 Bawdeejit Green Tea Lane 250B per hour ) . This place offers massage services plus herbal sauna rooms in which customers can steam themselves while drinking tea made from various herbs grown in their garden plus sip complimentary juices made from tropical fruits grown in their garden ! These services are very relaxing indeed! The sauna centre also organises weekly events including cookouts featuring local food products made using local products such as honey or coffee beans etc . There are several other small grocery stores located within walking distance selling products not commonly found elsewhere in Thailand such as Australian meat pies ! Be sure to bring your passport when visiting this area because all foreigners must register with immigration officials within 24 hours upon arrival into Thailand . Some guesthouses offer pick up service for this process while others require guests take public transport themselves since they may not have time during business hours when guests arrive since they need to keep working! Here are some additional addresses where foreigners must register : Airport Police Division 0 5327 1212 West Precinct Police Station 0 5322 6111 North Precinct Police Station 0 5327 6999 East Precinct Police Station 0 5332 0877 South Precinct Police Station 0 5321 6584 Immigration Office 0 5324 7620 Royal Thai Police Headquarters 0 5327 6121 Immigration Office Extension Office 10am-5pm Mon-Fri 0 5332 0437 Tourist police office 1st fl 400B per day cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B cash deposit 500B payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office payment upon leaving office 2nd fl 8am-noon Sat 9am−noon Sat 10am−noon Sun 9am−3pm Tue & Thu 8am−12pm Tue & Thu 8am−12pm Tue & Thu 8am−12pm Tue & Thu 8am−12pm Tue & Thu 8am−12pm Tue & Thu 8am−noon Wed Registration begins every 40 minutes beginning at 9:30 am Registration begins every 40 minutes beginning at 9:30 am Registration begins every 40 minutes beginning at 9:30 am Registration begins every 40 minutes beginning at 9:30 am Registration begins every 40 minutes beginning at 10 am Registration begins every 50 min beginning at 11 am Registration begins every 40 min beginning at 11 am Registration begins every 50 min beginning at 11 am Registration begins every 50 min
