![Camp Mashpi](../../img/jungle/pexels-greg-galas-2092828.jpg)

Camp Mashpi is a rustic camp nestled in the eastern part of the Amazon rainforest. For almost 20 years now, it’s been one of the best places to explore the Amazon. The camp is owned and operated by my family; they’ve been hosting guests at Mashpi Lodge for over 30 years now. We’re a small group with only 8 members in my family–so you can imagine how much attention is given to each and every guest who stays with us.

I was born in Quito, Ecuador, but grew up at Mashpi, so I have quite a lot of experience hosting people from all over the world here. I’ve worked as a tour guide for many of our guests–so I know exactly what they want to see and learn about when visiting our country. As soon as you arrive at Mashpi, you will feel like you’re being welcomed into our home!
