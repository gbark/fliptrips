          Camp Mashpi is a private campground owned by the Mashpi Foundation. It is located near the village of San Mateo, about 25 km north of Quito, or an hour's drive from the airport. There is a large pool, paddle boats, kayaks, a playground and other facilities. It is an ideal base for excursions to Mindo for bird-watching or to the Cuyabeno reserve for jungle hikes and canoeing.
