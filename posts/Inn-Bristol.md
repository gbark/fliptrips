Inn Bristol is a rustic inn with a very old feel. It has a lot of character and is in an area of the city that is not too crowded, but is close to downtown and all the major attractions. The rooms were clean and comfortable when we arrived. We stayed in two different rooms: one with two double beds and one with a single bed. Both were large enough and had enough space to store our suitcases and other things we needed for our stay. The breakfast was decent but could have been better. There is a nice porch that overlooks the river that we enjoyed sitting out on in the evenings, which was nice even though it was cooler than we would like because it had such a great ambiance. (Hotel guests get their own key to come and go as they please.) We did not use the pool or the hot tub, but it seemed like they were well-kept and utilized by many hotel guests at all hours of the day (and night). Overall, I think this is a good hotel with some room for improvement (the breakfast especially), but I would recommend staying here if you want something more unique than most hotels in this area of New Orleans.
