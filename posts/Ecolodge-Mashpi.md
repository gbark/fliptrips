Ecolodge Mashpi is a ecological ecolodge and sustainable living community located in the heart of the Panamanian rainforest. The ecolodge is part of a project called Yachana Foundation, which also has built a primary school and a medical post. The lodge is built on stilts and is surrounded by jungle on three sides. The main building has 3 floors (the ground floor is half underground with windows). The first floor has 3 bedrooms, shower and toilets; the second floor has two bedrooms and two showers; the top floor is open (no walls) with hammocks and more hammocks with views to 7 lakes in the area.

The Ecolodge Yachana is in a Private Conservation Area with strict environmental regulations. The access road to Ecolodge Yachana goes through the community where we live, so we always know how many people visit us every day. In addition to this, we have a guard 24 hours a day who collects information on who visits us and for what reason, tourist or volunteer work. Thanks to these procedures we feel that our conservation efforts are being strengthened every day that passes!

In order to get you here from Panama City it takes approximately 5 hours by bus, taxi or your own vehicle (only 4x4 recommended). We invite you to come experience a different side of Panama while making a difference in our local communities!
