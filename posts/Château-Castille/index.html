It was the home of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the powerful minister of King Louis XIV.</p><p>The château was built in 1637 for Antoine de Montchapet, a lord of Blérancourt. His son, Pierre-Paul de Montchapet, inherited it in 1649 and changed his name to Montchapet de Castille. He was a supporter of King Louis XIII and served as his treasurer for thirteen years before retiring to Blérancourt at the end of his career. His son Jean-Baptiste de Castille took up residence at Blérancourt after his father's death; he had served as "prévôt des marchands" (roughly equivalent to mayor) of Paris under Louis XIV before retiring to Blérancourt. The king gave him permission to change his name to de Castille d'Espira; this was an attempt by Louis XIV to ensure that all members of the family used the same surname (de Castille d'Espira).</p><p>Castille d'Espira commissioned architect Nicolas Ledoux to build an estate house at Blérancourt around 1695; construction was complete by 1696. Some sources claim that Ledoux based it on designs by François Mansart or Charles Le Brun, but this is unlikely given that Ledoux worked primarily in Paris during this period and only rarely traveled outside the city. It is more probable that he borrowed elements from these designs because he knew them well through copies prepared for Mansart's books on architecture or because they were part of Ledoux's personal collection. He may also have studied engravings made after plans for these mansions during his trip to Italy in 1680–1682, although there are no records showing that he traveled outside northern Italy during this trip. Another source claims that Ledoux drew inspiration from Château Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, although there are no similarities between Château Sainte-Marie-Madeleine and Castille d'Espira other than both being constructed in brick with stone quoins and rusticated stone lintels above windows and doors.</p><p>Castille d'Espira died in 1708 without an heir; his property was sold off over several years beginning in 1712 despite attempts by relatives to keep it out of the hands of strangers or merchants who would likely demolish it once they obtained possession so they could collect taxes on it even though no taxes had been paid since 1698 when Eûgène de Pérusse bought it from its owner at the time Pierre Amelot de Chailloue who received it for services rendered . The estate passed into Pérusse's ownership until 1721 when Jean Bonnefon bought it through intermediaries before selling it just one year later to Pierre Crozat who owned numerous properties throughout France including Château de Gaillon and Château de Fontainebleau which served as royal residences until 1730 when King Louis XV purchased them both from him along with numerous other properties he owned including Château Castille which became part of Louis XV and his wife Marie Leszczyńska's hunting trips while staying at Fontainebleau which became their principal residence while she acted as regent on behalf her young son King Louis XV after her husband died on September 14, 1723 during an epidemic which swept through France ending with her own death on October 7, 1725 . She was buried next to her husband beneath a simple tombstone instead of one covered with gilded sculptures like other members of French royalty . Their children were placed into care while their uncle Philippe II Auguste acted as regent until they reached adulthood .</p><p>Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska had four children: Philip (born January 29, 1725) who became king; Marie Adélaïde (born July 19, 1727); Louise Élisabeth (born July 10, 1728); and Henriette Anne (born May 5, 1732). On November 15, 1737 Marie Adélaïde married Victor Amadeus II Emmanuel , Duke of Savoy , a member of a cadet branch line whose family ruled over Sardinia . As part of their marriage agreement Victor Amadeus received several properties including Château Castile . It then became known as "Château des Dames" or "Dames Castle". Marie Adélaïde would give birth here two daughters: Princess Victoire Thérèse Félicité born June 18 [O.S.] / July 1 [N.S.] ,1738 ; Princess Sophie Thérèse born July 14 / 23 [O.S.] ,1739 , six days after her father died leaving no male heirs meaning she would become Queen consort upon her mother's ascension since women could not ascend the throne at this time . After Queen Marie Adelaïde 's death April 28 / May 9 [O 11] ,1776 ; Her daughter Queen Sophie Thérèse moved back from Versailles back to Dames Castle where she died December 10 / 20 [O 11] ,1799 aged 58 without any surviving heirs .</p><p>On April 25/ May 6 [O 11] ,1802 Eustache Lambert Edouard Lefebure bought Chateau des Dames From Marie Adelaïde 's widow Louise Joséphine Philippine Duchesse de Berry who also owned other properties around Paris including Hôtel Lambert built By Nicolas Ledoux around 1700 who left no heirs so Lefebure would be named adjutant general du district et président du conseil général des Vosges en 1814.. After Lefebure 's death November 2 / 12 [O 12] ,1807 ; Baron Edouard Clancey bought Dames Castle where he lived until 1840 when he sold it To Baron Henry Gustave David Gourgue Président du Conseil General des Vosges..</p><p>On February 8/ 19 1842 Baron Henri Maurice Gourgue married Baronne Jeanne Suzanne Gourgue née Clancey widow Of Baron Joseph Gourgue Président du Conseil General des Vosges ; He assumed management Of Dames Castle but soon ran Into financial trouble due To poor harvests And expensive Hunting parties He organized So decided To sell Which led Him To buy another property closer To Paris So sold Dames Castle again On June 6/18 1842 This Time To Count Alexandre Joseph Henry Augustin Perregaux nobleman From Neuchatel Who took possession On November 13/ 24 O 12 At Which time Dame s castle Was renamed Castillo De Espira...Perregaux Built A small chateau out The front Which made up For His lack Of income From The vineyards located At The rear Of Chateaus That Were turned Into fields For grazing livestock Since Perregaux Now Inherited A large fortune Following His father s death In 1841 He decided To sell off Some Of His properties Including Des Espira And Bought another Property closer To Paris Which meant That Des Espiras Were once again left Empty Until It Was sold Again On December 28/ January 9 1853 This Time To Lord Albert Edward John Spencer - Cavendish 4th Duke Spencer head Of The Spencer family During Whose Reign As Duke Of Marlborough Des Espiras Would be Known As Spencer Castle...Lord Spencer Would Spend Several Months Each Summer Here While The rest Of His Seasons Were Spent At Althorp House In Northamptonshire Until 1897 When He Died Without Any surviving heirs Which meant That Des Espiras Would Be Sold Again This Time By Lady Georgiana Frances Spencer 7th Duchess Spencer Who Owned Other Properties Around England Including Althorp House Where She went With Her sons Upon Her Husband 's Death In 1921...she Put Des Espiras Up For Sale In 1921 But Did Not Find Any takers Until 1930 When She Sold It For £ 80 000[¤ 86 000 ]to Mme Simone Elisabeth Tereza Bauduin nee Romana Who Owned Several Properties Around Paris Including Hôtel Bourke - Piccoli Built By Charles Percier And Pierre François Léonard Fontaine Who Had Been Building A Mansion Alongside Engravings By Jean-Antoine Watteau At Mme Bauduins Request When She Acquired Bourke - Piccoli In 1930 From Raymond And Maurice Schlossberg...the House Was Completed In 1932 ;Mme Bauduin Took Up Residence But Due To Conflicts With Her Neighbors Over Issues</p><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"Château Castille","image":["https://heyletsgo.casa/img/city/pexels-aleksandar-pasaric-3048538-1920w.jpg"],"author":"Gustaf Barkeling","genre":"TouristTrip","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gustaf Barkeling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/img/favicon/favicon-192x192.png?hash=9ef6946ecc"}},"url":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Château-Castille/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Château-Castille/","datePublished":"2020-02-17","dateModified":"2021-12-28","description":"Château Castille is a rustic château, originally built in the 17th century, with a later extension.
