Hotel & Spa Virgin Gorda is a gorgeous hotel & spa, high up on a hillside overlooking the Caribbean Sea. As I’ve written about before, this hotel is a tranquil oasis peeks out from the lush foliage of Virgin Gorda. It is a little jewel of a resort that has been designed with an eco-friendly touch, as it focuses on sustainable practices and green initiatives.

The rooms are very comfortable at this resort, as they have been modernized with the necessary features to make your stay as relaxing as possible. The bathroom is well-equipped and spacious and I especially liked the fact that each room has its own private balcony.

As for dining options, there are two restaurants – one casual and the other fine dining – plus a pool bar and a beach bar. At the pool bar you’ll find fresh fruit shakes and smoothies along with light snacks such as cheese platters and sandwiches. The beach bar serves up tasty cocktails such as Painkillers (dark rum, pineapple juice, peanut butter & coconut milk) along with small bite snacks such as crudites or roasted sweet potatoes topped with jerk seasoning.

I highly recommend trying out their signature bath menu (the sauna and steam room at this hotel come free!) which includes an array of spa services like massages, facials, body treatments and wraps. You can also enjoy treatments in your own room or suite if you wish! If you’re looking for some romantic alone time together, book one of their couples massage sessions (which can also be done in your room) – they offer Swedish massage (60 mins.) or Acupressure massage (90 mins.). I opted for the acupressure massage which was excellent! My husband opted for an hour long Swedish massage which he said was superb; he actually almost fell asleep at one point!
