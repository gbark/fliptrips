          Inn Paracas is a rustic inn with simple, cozy rooms and a great beach, just a half-block from the main drag. The building has been expanded several times to hold the 12 comfortable rooms and four apartments, which share three private beachfront terraces and a Jacuzzi in the garden. It’s in a residential neighborhood on the edge of the village, but it’s just a five-minute walk to restaurants and shops. All units have private baths and hammocks on their patios.
