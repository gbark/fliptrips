          Suites Gritti Palace is a romantic suites hotel in Venice, Italy, located on the Grand Canal between the Rialto Bridge and Ponte degli Scalzi. It was originally built for a rich family of Venetian merchants in the 15th century.

Gritti Palace Hotel is on the bank of the Grand Canal at Santa Croce, on one of its most scenic stretches, just a few minutes’ walk from Saint Mark’s Square. The hotel offers all the comforts of a modern hotel, yet has retained its historic charm with its Venetian-style interior spaces. This makes Gritti Palace Hotel one of the most romantic hotels in Venice.

Suites range from small to large and include different layouts that can be connected to accommodate larger parties or families traveling together. A number of suites are equipped with private terraces overlooking the canal or Saint Mark’s Square. Some suites feature frescoed ceilings and marble floors while others are more modern with private saunas or Jacuzzis. Room service is also available 24 hours a day throughout all four seasons at Gritti Palace Hotel in Venice for guests who wish to enjoy their meals in their rooms.

The palace is named after Francesco Gritti (1480-1577), who commissioned its construction and was himself born here in 1480 and lived there until his death in 1577 at age 97 years old! It was originally built by his father Pietro Gritti for his son Francesco when he married Maria Bragadina degli Scrovegni, daughter of Doge Giovanni Bragadino (1457-1523) and Bianca Foscari (daughter of Pietro Foscari, Doge 1423-1457). The palace stayed within the family until 1787 when it was bought by Venetian aristocracy Alberto Soranzo (1730-1820) who commissioned further renovations and added two new wings to it (one facing San Marco and another facing Piazzetta della Madonna). In 1936 it was bought by an Englishman Robert Byron (1905-41) author of "The Road to Oxiana" who died there at age 36 from typhus contracted while traveling through Russia). After WWII it became a luxury hotel following major restorations carried out by architect Giuseppe Brasini (1890-1972). Since 2002 it has been owned by Orient Express Hotels Ltd., who have maintained its high level of luxury while creating a unique atmosphere combining tradition with comfort and convenience without losing any charm along the way!
