Resort Aqua Beach is a jawdropping resort situated in the heart of Koh Rong mainland. The resort has 6 bungalows, all are individual and unique. You can stay in a luxury bungalow or in a traditional Cambodian house, depending on your style.

The bungalows are built on stilts, in case of high tide it can be very cool. If you decide to stay in one of the wooden houses, the bathroom is located outside (only separated by a small wall).

If you like to travel with your family or friends, every bungalow has its own terrace with sun loungers and hammocks. The resort has 3 swimming pools, 2 of them also used for swimming lessons for children. There is also an activity pool with water slides and pool games for adults and children alike.

The restaurant serves local Cambodian dishes but also western food like pancakes or pasta. You can also ask for different kinds of cocktails at the bar located near the 3rd swimming pool. For all people who want to party till late there is a bar with large sofas & pillow beds with ambient music right next to the beach!
