Château Cipriani is a sophisticated château style hotel located in the exclusive "Billionaires' Row" area of the city, on East Amherst Avenue. This is an exclusive neighborhood with home prices ranging from $20 million to over $100 million.

The property was originally built in 1925 by famed architect Stanford White for William K. Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who established the New York Central Railroad. The estate was later sold to Richard Hoyt-Vanderbilt, in 1937, whose family owned it until 1987 when they sold it to Rolf Sachs and his wife. Sachs had a vision to restore the property back to its original grandeur and hired Italian architect Annamaria Cipriani (no relation) and designer Jack Lenor Larsen to redesign and decorate the property into a luxurious five star hotel and restaurant. After six years of extensive renovations, Château Cipriani opened its doors as a luxury hotel and restaurant on December 13, 1993. The French chateau style mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of its Beaux-Arts architecture theme.
