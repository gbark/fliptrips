          Château Cipriani is a rustic château with a prominent history. It is located at Via Berchet 12 in the municipality of Castagnola, in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

The castle was built between 1867 and 1869 by an unknown architect for Giuseppe Cipriani, who wanted to create a house on Lake Lugano worthy of his wife, the former opera singer Adelina Domenica Vianini. The château is built in Neo-Gothic style with high towers on each corner. Archaeological excavations uncovered remains of an earlier castle that had been destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. The later one was completed in 1869 and remained with the Cipriani family until 1980. After 1980 it was used as a restaurant and more recently as a hotel, before falling into disrepair.

The large parkland surrounding the château is home to many species of flora and fauna including red deer, fallow deer, mini-donkeys, peacocks and peahens.
