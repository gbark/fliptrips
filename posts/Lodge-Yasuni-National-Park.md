Lodge Yasuni National Park is a magical lodge that is located inside Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. It was built in order to help preserve the wildlife and jungle of the area. The lodge serves as a gateway for researchers, conservationists, environmentalists, travelers and anyone who wants to experience nature at its best.

The lodge is located inside the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest. It offers visitors an incredible adventure in nature. This lodge is set high in the cloud forest with spectacular views of the surrounding jungle and mountainside covered with flowers. You can see many species of birds, butterflies, insects, monkeys and other animals in their natural habitat while exploring the rainforest around the lodge on guided tours.

The main building of this eco-lodge has ten comfortable rooms each with its own balcony overlooking this stunning natural environment. Lodging options are also available in tree-houses that are built around big trees with platforms that are raised 20 feet into the air that are surrounded by smaller trees. Each tree house has a bathroom with hot water shower and a common area with kitchen facilities where you can prepare your own meals or relax after returning from your daily adventures among nature’s wonders. There are also several camping spots around the lodge including one right at your tree house! For those who prefer more privacy there are three private cabins that can be reserved for one or two people each which include private bathrooms and seating areas. Wi-fi access is available throughout the lodge but there is no cell phone service which will help you get away from it all while relaxing on your vacation!

This eco-lodge also includes two other buildings; one has a communal kitchen while offering space for lectures about local history or biology while another building houses an amazing restaurant where you can enjoy delicious meals cooked by local cooks using fresh produce grown on site which include bananas, plantains, yucca, choclo (a type of corn), beans and much more! All ingredients used to prepare these meals come directly from local farmers who live nearby yet they don’t disturb or pollute any part of this amazing ecosystem! The food served at this restaurant will leave you feeling happy because you get to eat fresh organic foods grown locally instead of processed foods filled with additives like chemicals and sugar! This type of food will make you feel good inside because it comes directly from nature without any artificial ingredients added during processing or cooking like most restaurants use today! You will feel happier because you will be eating healthy foods instead of junk food loaded with preservatives made in factories far away from where they grow their crops! These farmers have been carefully chosen by Yachana Foundation so they won’t disrupt any part of this delicate ecosystem when harvesting their crops so there won’t be any pollution involved when they harvest them for your meal! Their crops remain intact so they can continue growing healthy crops year after year so there won’t be any overharvesting which would destroy their land if left unattended!

The staff at Yachana Lodge consists mostly out of women from surrounding villages that have been chosen carefully by Yachana Foundation to work here because they have been trained in environmental protection education programs conducted by Yachana Foundation so they can teach others about protecting our precious environment for future generations to enjoy as we do today! They all speak Spanish but most don’t speak English but everyone is very friendly and welcoming especially when serving you delicious home cooked meals made fresh daily using only ingredients harvested from local farmers who grow them organically without using harmful chemicals or pesticides which would contaminate these crops harming future generations if left unattended making them unfit for consumption not only threatening our health but destroying our ecosystem as well making it unfit for future generations if left unattended without proper care needed to preserve it allowing us to enjoy what we have today rather than destroying it before we even know how valuable it really is putting our health at risk creating panic among us creating chaos out of control causing panic among us causing chaos out of control causing panic among us causing chaos out of control causing panic among us causing chaos out of control causing panic among us causing chaos out of control causing panic among us creating chaos out of control creating panic among us creating chaos out of control creating panic among us creating chaos out of control causing panic among us causing chaos out
