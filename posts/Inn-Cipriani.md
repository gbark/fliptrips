Hotel Excelsior is the most prestigious hotel in Venice. It has 79 spacious rooms with all the comforts—including graceful public spaces and an inviting rooftop terrace with sweeping views of St. Mark’s Square (Sb/Db without view -€240, Sb/Db with view -€280, extra bed -€70, 10 percent discount if you book directly on their website—or double that if you book through my website but don’t use the credit card deposit feature). Its relaxing lounge is a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing (minimum 3 days in high season but no minimum in low season—which almost never happens). The hotel also rents a gorgeous two-bedroom apartment for up to six guests (Db-€500), and a six-bed dorm room for backpackers (€25 per person). To get here from the train station or San Marco Square, ride vaporetto #2 from either stop to the San Zaccaria stop and walk 10 minutes uphill along Calle Vallaresso to Campo Santa Maria Formosa. Or take vaporetto #5 from San Zaccaria to Salute and walk 10 minutes downhill along Campo Santa Maria Formosa past the Church of San Francesco della Vigna to reach it at #9041 (nonmembers can pay €9 in cash per night for a guest card that includes free Wi-Fi in lobby and some other benefits).

$$$ Hotel Villa Fiorita has 22 comfortable rooms set in a fine old building overlooking the Grand Canal from one side and quiet little Campo Santa Fiora from another. It’s well located for exploring Venice on foot or by vaporetto (#1 or #2 from Ferrovia/train station or #40 from Piazzale Roma), and has plenty of modern amenities (Sb/Db without view -€135 but check website for deals on weekdays and long stays—and look for B&B packages that include breakfast—or Db with view -€185: prices vary wildly depending on demand so it’s worth calling or emailing directly to ask about deals; air-con extra; elevator; near Salute vaporetto dock at Fondamenta della Croce 4156c, tel. 041-7304711, www.hotelvillacampione.com, info@hotelvillacampione.com).
