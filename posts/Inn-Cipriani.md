          Inn Cipriani is a romantic inn overlooking the Grand Canal. The hotel was originally built in 1840 by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of the famous Harry's Bar next door. The interior is exactly how it was when it was first opened with modern comforts added to make your stay comfortable.

The 70 rooms are divided amongst five floors. All the rooms are decorated with period furniture, original paintings and frescoes and private bathrooms with shower or bathtub. Some also have a small sitting room and private kitchenette.

There is a small private beach on one of the canals connected to the hotel.

Inn Cipriani is close to Piazza San Marco and Rialto Bridge as well as major shopping areas such as Mercerie, Calle Larga XXII Marzo, Calle delle Botteghe and San Polo.
