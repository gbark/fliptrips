![Inn Cipriani](../../img/city/pexels-leah-kelley-952586.jpg)

Inn Cipriani is a sophisticated inn housed in an old convent, with rooms (Sb-€95-150, Db-€160, Tb-€210; includes breakfast; air-con extra; elevator; parking garage-€20/day; Via Repubblica 13, tel. 041-240-2552, www.cipriani.com).

$$$ Hotel Excelsior is the most prestigious hotel in Venice. It has 79 spacious rooms with all the comforts—including graceful public spaces and an inviting rooftop terrace with sweeping views of St. Mark’s Square (Sb/Db without view -€240, Sb/Db with view -€280, extra bed -€70, 10 percent discount if you book directly on their website—or double that if you book through my website but don’t use the credit card deposit feature). Its relaxing lounge is a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing (minimum 3 days in high season but no minimum in low season—which almost never happens). The hotel also rents a gorgeous two-bedroom apartment for up to six guests (Db-€500), and a six-bed dorm room for backpackers (€25 per person). To get here from the train station or San Marco Square, ride vaporetto #2 from either stop to the San Zaccaria stop and walk 10 minutes uphill along Calle Vallaresso to Campo Santa Maria Formosa. Or take vaporetto #5 from San Zaccaria to Salute and walk 10 minutes downhill along Campo Santa Maria Formosa past the Church of San Francesco della Vigna to reach it at #9041 (nonmembers can pay €9 in cash per night for a guest card that includes free Wi-Fi in lobby and some other benefits).

$$$ Hotel Villa Fiorita has 22 comfortable rooms set in a fine old building overlooking the Grand Canal from one side and quiet little Campo Santa Fiora from another. It’s well located for exploring Venice on foot or by vaporetto (#1 or #2 from Ferrovia/train station or #40 from Piazzale Roma), and has plenty of modern amenities (Sb/Db without view -€135 but check website for deals on weekdays and long stays—and look for B&B packages that include breakfast—or Db with view -€185: prices vary wildly depending on demand so it’s worth calling or emailing directly to ask about deals; air-con extra; elevator; near Salute vaporetto dock at Fondamenta della Croce 4156c, tel. 041-7304711, www.hotelvillacampione.com, info@hotelvillacampione.com).


Near Stazione di Santa Lucia


These places are convenient to the train station and offer easy access to Piazzale Roma bus stops for excursions around town:

$$$ Hotel London is businesslike yet friendly, with 20 spacious rooms on one floor up a steep staircase under an aging facade (Sb/Db without view -125/145; Sb/Db with view -150/160 but prices vary wildly based on demand—so call ahead or email directly to ask about deals; air-con extra on higher floors only—request when booking online but not sure they can accommodate you if there are no free nonview rooms left when you arrive...because they have no bellhop service so you have to carry your bags up yourself...but it can be worth it if you get an upgrade at no extra cost because they have few reservations); breakfast not included but nearby bakeries open early enough if you want it (reservations required especially during festivals when they fill quickly—especially last minute); rates include safe deposit box at reception desk which comes in handy if leaving your bags while sightseeing) (Rialto Bridge side of train station at Riva degli Schiavoni 4386a). They also offer apartments nearby starting at €130 per night for two people sharing one room plus €30 per person past two people sharing one room)


Eating in Venice


Venice offers world cuisine served by waiters who are often dressed in costume in atmospheric settings overlooking canals teeming with gondolas. Reservations are smart during peak times such as lunchtime near Piazza San Marco or dinner time when cruise ships are docked nearby. On busy nights many restaurants require reservations even for drinks at their bar before dinner or drinks afterward. Thanks largely to cruise ships that fill this town several times daily throughout summer months, Venice is notorious for its skyrocketing prices...and tourists happily pay them! But because I feel guilty overcharging tourists who may come once but never come back again because I gouged them too much...I keep an eye out for affordable alternatives wherever possible below! Remember: When ordering zuppa di pesce “fish soup” here, there’s no need to pick just one fish out of dozens swimming around your bowl like it’s Noah’s Ark! Venetians proudly sample everything swimming around your plate...and enjoy watching tourists get squeamish over the same dish! Remember: If diners order more than one selection off any menu liste dei vini “wine list” offered by Venetian eateries today...they must pay extra per glass even if they share their bottle among three people! This practice helps diners avoid ordering wine by the glass which would require them ordering food as well because restaurants usually do not receive enough money back from their markup of wine by the glass compared with bottles ordered by diners who consume them entirely themselves while sharing their bottle among three people at table!


PONTE VECCHIO MARKET AND NEARBY FERRY TERMINALS


(See “Restaurants & Bars near Rialto Bridge & Ponte Rialto” map, here.)


The touristy zone surrounding Ponte Vecchio bridge offers grand views over this famous bridge as well as easy access by foot or boat across Venice’s Grand Canal and into its historic core (described next). The area between Rialto Bridge and Stazione Marittima is lined with tourist traps serving mediocre food at inflated prices: lots of drab pizzerias serving plasticky pizza slices wrapped up like burritos; touristy restaurants similar looking inside and out offering mediocre pasta dishes mostly composed of canned ingredients imported from North America such as corn kernels cut off cobs bound together like corn cobs bound together like books bound together like toilet paper rolls bound together like cakes bound together like socks bound together like underwear bound together...you get my drift...with meatballs produced via industrial machines under sterile conditions that may appear appetizing but lack freshness and flavor; profiteroles filled with ice cream shipped over frozen from Brussels just hours ago instead of being made locally using local ingredients just moments ago using authentic methods handed down through generations since cuisine was invented here centuries ago—and served alongside canned whipped cream produced under industrial conditions miles away rather than peaches ripened right under your nose last summer readymade whipped cream right off some cow somewhere else far far far away ummmmmm interesting....All these places make good photos but unsatisfying meals. They charge outrageous prices because they know tourists won’t know any better until after their first bite into what appears perfectly normal on first glance yet turns out surprisingly bland on first bite! These places appeal more to wallets than taste buds: Tourists eat here having fallen victim first not only because I point out how bad these places really are but also because they don't know that eating well doesn't necessarily mean eating expensively all day long! While many locals dine affordably elsewhere before coming here only as tourists do later after dark once these joints have been deserted by locals who have gone home full after dining cheaply elsewhere all day long....So remember: If you go here hungry before being seduced into overpaying later after dark by this area's glitzy facade alone then maybe you can save some money while still getting good food late enough after dark once everyone else has left....My advice? Eat this way during daylight hours before being lured into staying too late into evening where everything seems glitzy yet pricey once again....That said let me share my favorite eateries near Rialto Bridge....


Ristorante Trattoria Alla Madonna serves quality food affordably late into evening right across from Stazione Marittima ferry terminal TI desk inside Barovier Palace facing Doge's Palace (see map on here). Choose between seating indoors amid Venetian splendor or outdoors amid pigeons feasting off this zone's human waste seeping under
