          Ranch Pacuare is a magical ranch located in the jungles of the Pacuare River. It was founded in 1982 by Maritza and Mario, who lived at the ranch for its first twenty years before retiring. Their children, Michael and Maria, now own and run the ranch and continue to lead their guests on white water rafting adventures.

There are no roads leading to Pacuare Lodge, which means that rafting is the only way to get there. The Pacuare River stretches from its source high in the Cordillera Central mountain range down to where it meets the Caribbean Sea, making it one of Costa Rica's longest rivers. It's also one of its most beautiful: even when you're not exploring it by raft, you can look out from your cabin and see one stunning view after another.
