          Château Marylebone is a electric château (built between 1745 and 1755) in the City of Westminster. It is a Grade I Listed Building, and is currently used as a luxury 5-star hotel.

This magnificent mansion in the heart of London was built for the Duke of Chandos between 1745 and 1755 by the architect William Kent in a neo-classical style. The beautiful garden was designed by Capability Brown.

In 1778 Marylebone was bought by Lord Holland, father of Charles James Fox. Thereafter Charles James Fox spent much time here, entertaining his guests lavishly until his death in 1806 when he left all his estates to his sister Lady Holland. In 1829 she removed to Holland House and Marylebone Hall was let to a number of noble families who all added to its magnificence over the years. The last owner was Raymond Asquith, son of H. H. Asquith, who died in 1953 and bequeathed it to Middlesex County Council who used it for offices until 1972 when it was bought by Westminster City Council for possible use as a conference centre but it remained empty until 1980 when it became a Luxury Hotel with 52 bedrooms run by the Halkin Hotel Group - now Belmond Ltd - which restored it sympathetically with great care so that little has changed since its construction 200 years ago except that modern bathroom facilities have been installed on each floor.
