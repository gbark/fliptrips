          Ranch Sabi Sands is a rural ranch in a private conservation area. The ranch is a working cattle and wildlife ranch. Guests are welcome to participate in the daily workings of the farm and the interactions with the animals on the farm.

Charming stone house in a private conservation area. The house is surrounded by animals, animals on pasture, birds, bees, butterflies and more. Guests are welcome to participate in daily farm activities such as feeding animals or bringing them into barns at night. The house has WiFi, kitchen facilities and a bathroom with shower. There is a swimming pool available for guests only. Guests have access to communal areas such as kitchen and living room where they can relax or read a book on a couch or lounge chair. There is also a braai area where guests can use their own meat or buy meat from the farm (local rates apply). The land surrounding the property (Ranch Sabi Sands) is privately owned conservation land with plenty of game viewing possibilities including lions, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest etc... Guests are invited to join us for meals at R20 per person per meal (all meals served with traditional South African bread). Meals are served family style around an open fire pit (weather permitting). If you like game meat then this is your place!!! Our game meat comes from our own game reserves which borders our property (Sabi Sands) meaning that much of our game originates from this property! We also have other activities arranged for our guests such as night drives around the conservancy which offers excellent game viewing opportunities for guests who want to do so but don't have their own vehicle.

Our stay was wonderful! This accommodation gets your heart pumping! It's close enough to all activities but far enough away so you feel secluded! The hosts were very friendly and accommodating! We will be back!
