          Château Bristol is a vibrant château, with a rich past. The vineyard was planted by the monks of the abbey of Flaran in the 13th century. The estate was acquired by John Crockett in 1769, who converted it to a grange that supplied flour to the abbey. It has belonged to the family of Jean-Pierre Moueix since 1840.

The vineyard, sitting along the banks of the river Garonne, is on some of land on which vines have been cultivated for over 300 years. There are 40 hectares (99 acres) under vine with 21 different grape varieties, including 90% red grapes and 10% white grapes (Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon). The average age of vines is 35 years old.

The vineyard is divided into two parts: one on the north bank (the château), and another on the south bank (the domaine). A bridge connects them across a small island where Le Moulin de Laudun flour mill once stood. The mill had fallen into disrepair but it has recently been restored by Château Bristol owner Jean-Pierre Moueix and converted into an elegant restaurant overlooking the river Garonne. This restaurant is an integral part of Château Bristol's future development plans. Jean-Pierre Moueix purchased 4 hectares (10 acres) which will be replanted with new grape varieties including Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Colombard as well as Cabernet Franc for red wines in 2016

In addition to wine production, Château Bristol also produces brandies from different grape varieties: Armagnac from Ugni Blanc & Folle Blanche; Cognac from Ugni Blanc & Folle Blanche; Champagne from Ugni Blanc & Folle Blanche; Armagnac from Colombard & Jurançon blanc; Cognac from Colombard & Jurançon blanc; Champagne from Colombard & Jurançon blanc; Armagnac from Bartlett pear& Gros Manseng; Cognac from Bartlett pear& Gros Manseng; Champagne from Bartlett pear& Gros Manseng
