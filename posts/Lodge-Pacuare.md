          Lodge Pacuare is a breathtaking lodge located on the Pacuare River. The scenery is spectacular, the food is superb, and the guides are professional. There are three different lodges at this complex, which are all located within a short distance of each other. They are situated along the river so you have the sound of flowing water all around you. I stayed in the Lodge Pacuare Grande which was very comfortable and had beautiful views of the river from my balcony.

This lodge is located in a pristine rainforest where you can see toucans, monkeys, sloth, caiman and if you're lucky an ocelot or jaguar! Black Howler monkeys can be heard for miles around as they serenade the dawn with their howling call. The lodge itself is very comfortable and has great food and service. I enjoyed my stay here very much and recommend it highly to anyone interested in wildlife viewing and nature photography.
