Ranch Mashpi is a pristene ranch and recreation property located in the heart of the Otavalo Valley. Enjoy breathtaking views of the majestic Imbabura and Rumi√±ahui volcanoes from your private patio.

This 14 hectare (34 acre) ranch is located in Manzanita, a small village in the Otavalo Valley - one of Ecuador's most enjoyable and popular travel locations. This secluded location provides you with access to some of Ecuador's best hiking, horseback riding, bird watching, coffee tours, hot spring spas and more!

A number of local artisans have made their home here in Manzanita - so you can shop for unique crafts right outside your door. A full day can be spent visiting rustic artisan shops in nearby Quilotoa Village or Latacunga City.

The area also boasts several organic farms that are excellent for tours or just to pick up fresh produce. The Eloisa Organic Farm is just a short 15 minute drive from the ranch. A visit there will leave you with a greater knowledge of how food is grown in Ecuador which will make you appreciate your meal all that much more!
