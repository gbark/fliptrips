Hotel di Positano is a romantic hotel in a beachfront location. This is a family run hotel with a good restaurant and a beautiful garden with views of the sea. We stayed in the Ocean View Double room. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable with an amazing view! The breakfast was good and the staff super friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Positano!

"Luxury at its best"



This is our second stay here and we cannot fault it one bit. We stayed in the new wing, which was absolutely immaculate and so luxurious - we loved our room so much we did not want to leave it! It would be unfair to say which we liked best as both were great - I cannot speak highly enough about this place - perfect location, excellent service, great food and lovely staff!
