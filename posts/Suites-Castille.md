          Suites Castille is a gorgeous suites hotel. The staff was very accommodating and the rooms were beautiful. I would definately stay there again.

Great location! My husband and I had a very pleasant stay during our last visit to Montreal. We found the hotel in excellent location and enjoyed walking around the neighborhood. The room was spacious and clean and we loved the fireplace! However, it is a bit expensive for what you get.

This is a cute little boutique hotel within walking distance to great restaurants in Montreal. The staff are very attentive and helpful with any questions you have about areas to visit or directions on how to get there. They offer complimentary water bottles in your room which is nice after a long day of walking around the city. I would recommend this hotel for anyone that visits Montreal that wants to be in a quiet neighborhood but still close enough to walk everywhere or take public transit which is steps away from the hotel itself! They do serve breakfast but it's not anything extravagant but there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance so you can grab something there if you'd like!
