          Palace Shoreditch is a stylish palace of a hotel, where opulence is at the heart of everything. It is an iconic 5* boutique hotel located in the centre of East London.

The hotel, which opened in September 2013, was built on the site of the former White Cube Gallery. Designed by Conran & Partners, who also designed The Sanderson Hotel, it boasts a wonderful rooftop terrace with views over London.

The interior design is by David Collins Studio and includes signature pieces from Jonathan Saunders‚Äô SS15 collection to bring luxury to every room. The decor is modern and edgy with an eclectic mix of masculine and feminine styles.

Amenities include a steam room, sauna and jacuzzi on site for relaxation after busy days exploring London‚Äôs sights. The hotel has 11 meeting rooms for up to 80 people which can be hired for just about any event or occasion. There are also two private dining rooms available for large bookings or events where you want maximum privacy.

For dining options there are two restaurants including Palings Steakhouse which can be hired out for private dining parties as well as the ultimate burger restaurant called MeatLiquor (website) which also has its own private dining room too (website). The service level at this hotel was wonderful ‚Äì I could not fault it at all! On arrival we were shown around our suite by one of the concierges who gave us lots of great information about all there was to do in Shoreditch and how to get around town easily without getting lost like I always do! You can book tours through reception or one of their concierges if you don‚Äôt want to organise them yourself ‚Äì the concierge team are very knowledgeable about London and can recommend things based on your interests! Breakfast was served from 8am from Monday-Friday but from 7am on weekends ‚Äì they have a full English breakfast as well as breakfast burritos & smoothies too! We loved that they had a variety of cereals as well as fresh fruit & toast ‚Äì very important when travelling with young children! They have a fantastic selection of juices too ‚Äì fresh orange juice with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice made me feel refreshed before my day started! We had dinner at MeatLiquor twice during our stay ‚Äì it is one of those places that if you go once you will definitely go back again! It‚Äôs a very popular place so booking your table would be advisable but we managed to eat there twice without booking first time round ‚Äì just go early if you don‚Äôt want to wait long for your table! The food is incredible ‚Äì they really know how to make great burgers here along with other delicious treats such as deep fried Oreos! They have an amazing range of drinks too including cocktails & champagne cocktails ‚Äì my husband loved his ‚ÄúPimm‚Äôs OJ‚Äù cocktail which he got both times we ate here along with popcorn chicken wings & fries each time we ate here too üôÇ
