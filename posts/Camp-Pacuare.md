Camp Pacuare is a magical camp, it’s secluded, the guides are amazing, the food was good and I got to see a sloth! The zip lining was amazing too.”

– Leah, High School student

“It was amazing! I would recommend the trail hike/zip line to everyone who wants to get out of the city. It was nice to be in nature and away from all the distractions of daily life.”

– Melissa, High School student

“I loved it! The views were incredible! It felt like we were in another world. I would definitely return in the future with friends or family members.”

– Pamala, High School student
