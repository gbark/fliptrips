          Camp Pacuare is a breathtaking camp with stunning views of the river, canopy walks and hanging bridges. The following is an excerpt from their website:

Explore the rainforest canopy on a series of high rope bridges between platforms located 15-40 feet above the forest floor.

Hike through pristine rainforest to our private beach where you can relax with a picnic lunch, take a dip in the refreshing river, or try your hand at fishing.

Enjoy three tasty meals served daily under our open-air palapa.

Camping at Camp Pacuare is available on an exclusive basis for groups of up to 12 people, making for an idyllic retreat any time of year. Camp Pacuare offers some of the best white water rafting in Costa Rica on its Class II+ section of the Rio Pacuare on which you will experience some of the most exciting rapids on river right! It is also one of our favorite adventure travel destinations in Costa Rica with many first-rate outfitters offering whitewater rafting trips here. Other activities include hiking on canopy walkways and zip lining.
