Inn Sabi Sands is a ecological inn that is located in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve in South Africa. It has been built in such a way that it blends into the surroundings and does not affect the wildlife, either in appearance or with noise pollution. The Inn is designed for comfort and to enhance the guests’ safari experience by providing an opportunity for interaction with the wild animals right outside one’s bedroom door.

The design of the Inn has taken into account factors like climate control, solar energy, water harvesting, natural ventilation and waste disposal, among others. The roof of the building is covered with glass panels which let light into the building during day time and also provide a view into the game reserve at night. Inside the rooms there are large windows that allow for views of animals on both sides of them; one side is towards their dens while other side looks out towards more open spaces.

The rooms are all designed with different themes to give them character. Each has its own outdoor area where guests can relax or dine at leisure. The dining area is located near a waterhole so guests can watch animals drink while they enjoy their meal. There are also viewing decks around this area where guests can sit down to relax after a long day of game drives or simply watch the animals enjoy themselves without feeling like they are intruding on their privacy.

Another interesting feature of this Inn is that it has its own ecological pest control system that helps keep pests under control without harming any of the local fauna or flora around it. The system works by attracting birds which feed on pests like tsetse flies and termites, thus keeping them under control without using any harmful chemicals or insecticides which could, otherwise affect other species living in these areas as well as pollute this pristine environment further.
