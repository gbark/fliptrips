          Private Island Ocean View is a jawdropping private island resort located near the coast of St. Lucia. It features a luxurious design that will leave you speechless.

The floating island resort was designed by Architects Edgardo Contreras and Manuel Salinas of Estudio 3.0, and it’s located just off the shore of the island. It comprises two islands, one for dining and one for living, which are linked together with a bridge. The living island has six bedrooms where guests can stay overnight, while the dining island has an outdoor bar that serves delicious food to visitors.

The best part about this private island resort is that it floats above the water, so you can enjoy an amazing view of the sea below you. There’s no need to worry about climbing up and down ladders, either – guests simply take an elevator from the water to their floating-island homes!

Architecture studio Architecture has designed this beautiful beach house in Nicaragua on stilts with beautiful wooden decks around it. The stilts create enough room underneath for storage areas as well as other extra features like hammocks and loungers that allow you to relax outdoors while still enjoying a view of your gorgeous surroundings.

This is another example of how architecture can be used to enhance your life outdoors instead of detracting from it like most modern architects do nowadays (cough cough). I wonder what kind of hurricane proofing measures they provided on this one? Anyway, I love how open and airy it feels here on top of these stilts! A gorgeous design if I’ve ever seen one!
