![Camp Grosso](../../img/jungle/pexels-teguh-sugi-6121916.jpg)

Camp Grosso is a charming camp offering a special blend of French and western cultures. The location is spectacular, right between the Grosse and Petite Carp lakes, with activities such as canoeing, kayaking, swimming in the lakes, fishing for rainbow trout and arctic greyling. In the evenings enjoy campfires, marshmallows by the lake and music around a bonfire. We will have a specialized program for kids aged 5–10.


Camp Menargues is a beautiful camp between the beautiful lakes of Temiscamingue located just 45 minutes from Montreal. The landscape is beautiful with lots of trees and easy access to water. We offer all kinds of aquatic activities such as kayaking, canoeing or tubing down the river. In addition to activities on land we also have a great adventure park with zip lines and challenge courses among others things! There are many fun evening activities such as campfires, disco & karaoke night! In addition to our French camps we also run 3 bilingual camps in 2018 - Camp Raconteurs (for kids aged 5-10), Camp Explorateurs (for kids aged 11-16) and Camp Découvrons (for teens aged 14-17).
