          Camp Grosso is a charming camp next to a small stream. It is a very comfortable camp in a quiet location, good for families and groups of friends.

Vitals: Camp Grosso, in the Serra do Roncador in Brazil's Pantanal, sleeps 10 with one private room and two shared rooms with bunk beds in each. The dining room is spacious enough to seat all your guests at once for meals around the table. A large deck overlooks the stream with an outdoor grill for cooking at night. A smaller deck has a hot-water shower and toilet cubicle off it, making it more private for guests sharing this room.

The property sits on top of a hill overlooking beautiful countryside with rolling hills and scrubby forestland dotted with cattle ranches. There are some sandstone outcrops along the way up to the house overlooking the valley below; this is common throughout the region, which is known as "canaleta" landscape (i.e., sandstone outcrops poking through rich pasture). It's within easy walking distance of several fishing spots along the river including their own private stretch of river that you can fish at dawn or dusk or whenever you like. The pool area has an outdoor fire pit for evening gatherings; dinner under the stars here would be especially nice if there were no bugs... but there always are! The pool itself is deep enough to do laps if you want to get serious about your swimming while here!

Getting There: Head east from Corumba toward Sao Felix do Araguaia; if coming from Bonito or Campo Grande, head east on BR-060 toward Corumba. At km 90 take BR-163 north toward Barão de Melgaço/Brasilândia/Anaurilândia/Sao Felix do Araguaia/Paranaíta/Mirassol d'Oeste/Guiratinga/Capanema Passes (or whatever else it says on whatever sign you see). At km 240 turn left onto dirt road heading south toward Corumba (there's no sign here but it's pretty obvious). Drive south 4 km to camp entrance on right side of road before bridge over Rio Roncador at km 246 (huge blue sign saying "Grosso" marks entrance); continue ahead to cross bridge then turn right immediately after crossing bridge onto gravel track leading down slope to camp entrance ; drive up slope to house above campground past parking area on left side of road; look for big wooden sign over driveway saying "Camp Grosso" when driving up slope from bridge.
