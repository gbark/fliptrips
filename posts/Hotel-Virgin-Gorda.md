          Hotel Virgin Gorda is a upscale hotel in the middle of a rain forest, in a small town on the Island of Virgin Gorda. The hotel has a very nice beach and a pretty good restaurant. The hotel is actually part of the larger resort called the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor Village. This is one of the best resort areas in the Caribbean. The place has it all, excellent restaurants, diving, fishing, snorkeling and more. This is not a place to go if you want to party all night at a disco or have a drink at any of the local bars. This is more of a family vacation type resort and for this type of vacation it is perfect.
