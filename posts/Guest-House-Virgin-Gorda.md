Guest House Virgin Gorda is a sun-soaked guest house that is an easy walk from the airport. The breakfast is outstanding with a wide selection of items, all made fresh daily. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this stop if you are traveling through the BVI's.

Beautiful B&B 4,6 sur mai 12, 2014 Beautiful setting, wonderful breakfast with great variety, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay!

Wonderful vacation 5 sur avril 23, 2014 Virgin Gorda is one of our favorite places on earth and we have stayed at most of the hotels there over the years. Sunset House was one of the best! The location allowed us to explore all over the island by bike or car (no need for a car if you stay here). The staff were super helpful and super nice; they know everything about everything on Virgin Gorda (from restaurants to scuba diving). They were always there to help no matter what time of day it was (and they make amazing breakfasts!). When we return to Virgin Gorda we will definitely stay here again!

Great place to stay in Virgin Gorda 4,2 sur avril 11, 2014 We stayed one night at Sunset House in March 2014 and had a great experience. Our room had an excellent view of Gun Creek -- if you like bird watching or just want some peace and quiet this is definitely where you want to be! It's also only about 5 minutes walk down to Little Dix Bay so it has easy access to restaurants and bars but still feels private away from everything else. Highly recommended!
