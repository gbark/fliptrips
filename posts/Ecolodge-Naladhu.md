Ecolodge Naladhu is a ecological ecolodge located in the dense jungle of the Sibambe bay, on the coast of the Golfo Dulce, at only 25 minutes from Puerto Jim√©nez. The ecolodge is located just 5 minutes by boat from Nosara. You can enjoy beautiful views of the beach and Nosara river. The lodge is ecological and offers accommodations for up to 14 people in 4 cabins with private bathrooms, hot water, ceiling fans and hammocks where you can enjoy an unforgettable experience in nature. There is a restaurant-bar with ocean view where you can taste local dishes and beverages made with healthy ingredients such as coconut water and organic coffee. On site we have a good variety of tropical plants and trees that contribute to create a unique ecosystem that allows us to learn about nature and its importance in our environment. Our goal is to provide our clients with experiences that allow them to connect with nature and learn about its importance for their health and well-being while enjoying their vacation in Costa Rica.
