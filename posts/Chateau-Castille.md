Chateau Castille is a rustic Chateau, originally built in the 17th century, with a later extension. It was the home of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the powerful minister of King Louis XIV.

The Chateau was built in 1637 for Antoine de Montchapet, a lord of Blérancourt. His son, Pierre-Paul de Montchapet, inherited it in 1649 and changed his name to Montchapet de Castille. He was a supporter of King Louis XIII and served as his treasurer for thirteen years before retiring to Blérancourt at the end of his career. His son Jean-Baptiste de Castille took up residence at Blérancourt after his father's death; he had served as "prévôt des marchands" (roughly equivalent to mayor) of Paris under Louis XIV before retiring to Blérancourt. The king gave him permission to change his name to de Castille d'Espira; this was an attempt by Louis XIV to ensure that all members of the family used the same surname (de Castille d'Espira).

Castille d'Espira commissioned architect Nicolas Ledoux to build an estate house at Blérancourt around 1695; construction was complete by 1696. Some sources claim that Ledoux based it on designs by François Mansart or Charles Le Brun, but this is unlikely given that Ledoux worked primarily in Paris during this period and only rarely traveled outside the city. It is more probable that he borrowed elements from these designs because he knew them well through copies prepared for Mansart's books on architecture or because they were part of Ledoux's personal collection. He may also have studied engravings made after plans for these mansions during his trip to Italy in 1680–1682, although there are no records showing that he traveled outside northern Italy during this trip. Another source claims that Ledoux drew inspiration from Chateau Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, although there are no similarities between Chateau Sainte-Marie-Madeleine and Castille d'Espira other than both being constructed in brick with stone quoins and rusticated stone lintels above windows and doors.

Castille d'Espira died in 1708 without an heir; his property was sold off over several years beginning in 1712 despite attempts by relatives to keep it out of the hands of strangers or merchants who would likely demolish it once they obtained possession so they could collect taxes on it even though no taxes had been paid since 1698 when Eûgène de Pérusse bought it from its owner at the time Pierre Amelot de Chailloue who received it for services rendered . The estate passed into Pérusse's ownership until 1721 when Jean Bonnefon bought it through intermediaries before selling it just one year later to Pierre Crozat who owned numerous properties throughout France including Chateau de Gaillon and Chateau de Fontainebleau which served as royal residences until 1730 when King Louis XV purchased them both from him along with numerous other properties he owned including Chateau Castille which became part of Louis XV and his wife Marie Leszczyńska's hunting trips while staying at Fontainebleau which became their principal residence while she acted as regent on behalf her young son King Louis XV after her husband died on September 14, 1723 during an epidemic which swept through France ending with her own death on October 7, 1725 . She was buried next to her husband beneath a simple tombstone instead of one covered with gilded sculptures like other members of French royalty . Their children were placed into care while their uncle Philippe II Auguste acted as regent until they reached adulthood . 

Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska had four children: Philip (born January 29, 1725) who became king; Marie Adélaïde (born July 19, 1727); Louise Élisabeth (born July 10, 1728); and Henriette Anne (born May 5, 1732). On November 15, 1737 Marie Adélaïde married Victor Amadeus II Emmanuel , Duke of Savoy , a member of a cadet branch line whose family ruled over Sardinia . As part of their marriage agreement Victor Amadeus received several properties including Chateau Castile . It then became known as "Chateau des Dames" or "Dames Castle". Marie Adélaïde would give birth here two daughters: Princess Victoire Thérèse Félicité born June 18 [O.S.] / July 1 [N.S.] ,1738 ; Princess Sophie Thérèse born July 14 / 23 [O.S.] ,1739 , six days after her father died leaving no male heirs meaning she would become Queen consort upon her mother's ascension since women could not ascend the throne at this time . After Queen Marie Adelaïde 's death April 28 / May 9 [O 11] ,1776 ; Her daughter Queen Sophie Thérèse moved back from Versailles back to Dames Castle where she died December 10 / 20 [O 11] ,1799 aged 58 without any surviving heirs .
