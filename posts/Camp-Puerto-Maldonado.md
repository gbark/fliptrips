Camp Puerto Maldonado is a magical camp. It is located on the banks of the Madre de Dios river, which is itself a tributary of the Amazon river, just after it has exited the Tambopata reserve.

The river itself is very still and quiet at this point, but parallel to it are some excellent stretches of water for theming.

A few minutes walk away are the tributaries that enter into the main river, which are perfect for white water rafting. This is a great camp for anyone looking to do some kayaking on some of the best rivers in South America.

The location itself is absolutely stunning. There are some breathtakingly beautiful views throughout this camp with birds singing in the surrounding trees, monkeys swinging through them and calling out, and all sorts of other wildlife for you to look out for as you explore your surroundings.

Accommodation is very good with private rooms inside modern cabins with comfortable beds and more than enough space to have your belongings around you while you are not using them. The bathrooms are attached to each cabin so your privacy will always be protected! The cabins have mosquito nets on their windows so you can leave them open all night if you want without being bitten by any insects!

There is also an excellent restaurant with a wide variety of delicious food on offer including an amazing breakfast that will give you energy for your activities all day long!
