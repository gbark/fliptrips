Private Island Paracas is a spiritual private island in Peru. It’s the last and only coastal remains of the giant sand dunes that used to cover most of the South American coastline. The surrounding sea is a translucent turquoise and the water is warm and clean. There are crystal clear waters and gorgeous sunrises. The island has an amazing archaeological site called Cerro Colorado which you can visit for free.

The area is full of wildlife such as foxes, birds, deer, lizards, flamingos and iguanas. There are also huge numbers of fish here so it’s a great place to go fishing or snorkelling in the sea. You can find some very special and rare species here such as sea lions and dolphins (although they keep their distance). One of the best features is that there are no sharks in this area! If you want to relax with your loved one this location is perfect for you. It will make for an unforgettable experience filled with romance, tranquility and peace.

There are several retreats on Isla de la Plata but one which stands out from all others is Adalberto Madrigal’s Casa Madrigal retreat (Casa Madrigal), where you will find peace, serenity, comfort, privacy, excellent food (vegetarian options) along with exquisite service (private chef at your service) at reasonable prices (less than US$70 per night per person). They have accommodation options including tipis for couples or family groups to cabanas where you can spend time alone or with your family or friends. The tipis come with mattresses but you need your own sleeping bags (you can rent them there at a low price). The cabanas include beds but it’s good to bring your own sleeping bags if possible because they don’t give blankets (it gets cold at night). You can also rent tents to bring if needed. There are two hot water showers on-site at each accommodation options so it’s not necessary to bring camping gear if you don’t want to. Be aware that there isn’t any electricity on-site so I recommend bringing solar powered torches/lanterns or headlamps if possible if planning on hiking around the island during the night time hours to see different animals like foxes who come out at night looking for food & mates!

The retreat offers workshops full of information about plant medicine & dietas which I highly recommend doing before coming here if possible since they help you prepare for this journey prior to arrival! If not then there are plenty of workshops once here offered by experts in ayahuasca & other plant medicines which will help provide answers & healing for lots of people who are traveling here from all over the world!

One thing I really liked about Casa Madrigal was the fact that they have a large number of volunteers who work hard everyday helping guests feel comfortable during their stay by providing them with lots of information about what they offer & how things operate around here! This is important because it helps guests understand what is going on around them instead of being confused about what happens here during their stay which makes them feel more relaxed & happy during their stay!
