Hotel Providence is a stylish hotel in the heart of downtown Providence. It has a very hip and stylish bar, and a great restaurant (irish pub type food with a selection of microbrews). We ate there for breakfast and it was very tasty. Everyone in our group was incredibly impressed with how nice this hotel was. Staff were friendly and helpful, and they had really nice monogrammed robes in the rooms. The lobby and bar area is very hip and cool, with lots of vintage elements to it. Comfortable beds, nice linens, beautiful bathroom - we all loved this place!
