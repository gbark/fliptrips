the breakfast was good, the room was clean and nice, the staff were friendly. - The staff were very helpful and accommodating. They also had a complementary shuttle service to the tube station which was very useful.

We spent our 10th wedding anniversary here and loved it! The hotel is small but very nice and with nice details; the beds are very comfortable; the breakfast is great; our room had a view to the palace grounds. I would definitely recommend this place - It's not expensive either!
