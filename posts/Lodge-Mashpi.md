          Lodge Mashpi is a remote lodge accessible only by boat and located at the southern end of the Yanayacu Biological Corridor. The lodge has nine rooms (one is pet friendly) and a dining hall where meals are served family style. Activities include birdwatching, boating, hiking and community tourism visits to local communities.

This jungle lodge is run by the Manu Wildlife Center and is located within the park boundaries – it’s a great option for those who want to support sustainable tourism in Peru. The lodge has five simple rooms with shared facilities, plus a bar and restaurant that serves three tasty meals daily plus snacks throughout the day. The prices are per person per day, including meals, activities and transfers from Cuzco to the Manu Wildlife Center at Puerto Maldonado (about 45 minutes), but excluding park fees of S100 per person per day (paid directly to the park upon arrival).

Eating

There are several comedores on or near Av El Sol in Puerto Maldonado. There are also several good restaurants in town including some with views of the riverfront on Av El Sol between Calles 28 de Julio and Hualinga, which can be reached on foot via an elevated walkway that connects them all.

Information

Money

All of the banks on Av El Sol have ATMs that accept Visa cards, but they charge between 3% and 4% of your withdrawal amount for using them. If you have an Amex card or another type of credit card without a PIN number you can use it at most travel agencies in town to get cash advances on your credit card against your deposit receipts from tour operators or accommodations – these usually don’t charge any fees although there’s always some chance they might be able to see your account information if they call your bank for verification after you leave town (so it’s best not to use this option unless you don’t mind someone knowing how much money you have). Most banks will change traveler’s checks but it may take some time (bring small bills with you when exchanging large denominations).

Tourist Information

The Oficina de Información Turística (Av El Sol s/n; 8am-1pm & 2:30-5:30pm Mon-Fri) is helpful for general information about Puerto Maldonado and tours around Peru but if you need information about Madre de Dios specifically this is not the place to go – most locals know very little about their own region! It has useful maps of Puerto Maldonado though so if you need something printed out it’s worth visiting anyway just for that. Also ask here about tours offered by bilingual naturalist guides from Madre de Dios Expeditions (Click here).

Getting There & Away

Air

LC Peru (www.lcperu.pe) flies four times per week between Lima and Puerto Maldonado via Tarapoto aboard its twin turboprop planes which seat eight passengers each – flights cost around US$300 one way depending on season times/dates etc accomondation@manunaturelodge .com). LC Peru departs from Aeropuerto Alejandro Velasco Astete in Tarapoto while Peruvian Airlines has its office right outside LC Peru’s office at Aeropuerto Alejandro Velasco Astete in Tarapoto city center near Hotel Casa Andina Larco Tarapoto (%065-81-2355; http://tarapotohotelcasayandinalarco.com; Av José Larco s/n) so if you book through PPeruvian Airlines only make sure you get a flight departing from Aeropuerto Alejandro Velasco Astete in Tarapoto so as not to get confused about which airport actually needs to be booked through PPeruvian Airlines! PPeruvian Airlines flies twice daily from Lima directly into Aeropuerto Alejandro Velasco Astete in Tarapoto city center arriving at 8:50am & 6:45pm Monday through Friday only while Saturdays there are two direct flights from Lima arriving at 7:50am & 4:40pm – PPeruvian Airlines does not fly direct into Puerto Maldonado due to issues related with their lease agreements with airports around Madre de Dios…but never fear! Just buy your flight ticket online through PPeruvian Airlines flying out of Aeropuerto Alejandro Velasco Astete in Tarapoto city center instead of flying out of Aeropuerto Internacional Mateo Pumacahua near Puerto Maldonado town center (Perene) like every other airline does…it might cost a few hundred soles more than flying out of Perene but at least it avoids all this confusion! Other domestic airlines serving Puerto Maldonado include LAN (%01-213-8200; www.lan.com), TANS (%01-705-9000; www.tansperu.com), Star Perú (%01-705-9000; www.starperu .com) and SAETA (%051-417520; www .saetaperuana .com). LAN offers cheap tickets sometimes as low as US$75 one way between Lima and Puerto Maldonado yet rarely if ever actually offers any availability when checked online so we recommend booking tickets directly through LC Peru instead which has more reliable availability options available even though their tickets may cost slightly more than LAN's cheap fares sometimes...but again never mind because once again this whole issue can be avoided entirely by booking cheap flights online directly through LC Peru anyways instead of booking expensive flights through SAETA which only operates flights between Arequipa & Madre de Dios region…but again never mind! You don't need any more information than that anyway because once again just buy your tickets online directly through LC Peru anyways since sometimes they're even cheaper than doing so via SAETA even though it's often hard finding any availability whatsoever…but once again don't worry because just buy your tickets via LC Peru anyways since sometimes they're even cheaper than doing so via SAETA even though it's often hard finding any availability whatsoever...
