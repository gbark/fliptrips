Lodge Mashpi is a rustic lodge perched on a cliff overlooking the rushing water of the Rio Mashpi. It has three rooms, all with private bathrooms and hot water. The rooms are wood-floored and decorated with hand-carved furniture; those in the main building have views of the river below. Lodge rooms share a large open-air dining area and kitchen.

The best hotel in town is right next to the Iglesia de San Gil on a quiet street. The tastefully decorated rooms are furnished with wood furniture, including two double beds, armoires and wardrobes, dressers or writing desks outfitted with telephones or radios that work up here in the clouds! The service is excellent, as are the grounds – they’re beautifully landscaped for strolling between buildings – which include a pool surrounded by gardens of begonias, heliconias and bromeliads blooming among rocks and sculptures by local artists.
