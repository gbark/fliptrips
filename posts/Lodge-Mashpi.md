Lodge Mashpi is a rustic lodge perched on a cliff overlooking the rushing water of the Rio Mashpi. It has three rooms, all with private bathrooms and hot water. The rooms are wood-floored and decorated with hand-carved furniture; those in the main building have views of the river below. Lodge rooms share a large open-air dining area and kitchen.

This comfortable hotel has 20 spacious, elegant rooms with wooden floors and traditional furnishings, including carved wardrobe closets and four-poster beds draped in mosquito nets. There's a pleasant common area with views of the lush gardens and river below, as well as an inviting restaurant (mains S22 to S30).
