Hotel Sunset Dream is a rustic hotel that is located in the middle of nature. This hotel is located in the heart of the green, at the top of a hill, which gives you an overview of all the green valleys. Here you can feel yourself like home.

This hotel has 6 rooms with twin beds and 6 rooms for two people (double bed). Each room has its own bathroom and balcony or terrace with view to the mountains. There is also a common area with television and kitchenette where you can meet other guests and talk about your adventures during day trip tours.

We serve breakfast every morning with fresh bread, cheese, local jams and fresh juice. You will also find free internet and free parking on site.
