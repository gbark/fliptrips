You can rent the rooms with or without breakfast.</p><p>En Route: Positano to Amalfi</p><p>From Positano, head along the coast road towards Amalfi. Along the way, you will pass through villages like Praiano, Vietri sul Mare and Minori. You will also see several beautiful beaches like Conca dei Marini and Castellammare di Stabia.</p><p>At the end of this stretch is Amalfi, an ancient town perched on a cliff at the foot of Monte Cerreto. On one side is the sea, on the other side is an impressive mountain range known as Maiella (or Majella). The city is famous for its port and terraced lemon groves. It’s also known for its lace making tradition which dates back to Byzantine days. Some of its souvenirs are said to be made by women who are over 100 years old!</p><p>One attraction that you should not miss at Amalfi is Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta (Cathedral of Saint Mary Assumed into Heaven). It’s a Romanesque church built in 1073 AD and it has been rebuilt several times over the centuries. Its Gothic bell tower stands tall at 61 meters high and from there you have a panoramic view of the hillsides below. Inside, you will find a beautiful baptismal font which dates back to 1240 AD as well as a statue of Saint Andrew by Gagini, a 13th-century sculptor from Pisa who created it in 1260 AD for Palazzo del Podestà in Pisa before being relocated here in 1358 AD after being moved from its original location inside Palazzo del Podestà in Pisa due to Napoleon’s invasion during which it was damaged during World War II bombings in 1944 AD. This statue was moved to Vico Equense from Palazzo del Podestà where it was damaged again during World War II bombings before being moved once more to Amalfi for safekeeping where it replaced an earlier statue destroyed during World War II bombings which itself replaced a 14th-century wooden statue which was burned down by arsonists in 1836 AD before being replaced by another bronze statue destroyed by Arsonists again around 1880 AD before being replaced yet again with yet another one created by another artist named Cipriano Facchino who worked on this project between 1906 – 1913 after creating other statues such as that of Saint Michael Archangel located behind Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta together with that of Saint Anthony Abbot located beside Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta and those found inside both churches San Pietro Martire and San Bartolomeo Abate respectively), both designed to protect against earthquakes and fires – including those caused by arsonists – which could threaten life and property within their communities at risk or face destruction due to such calamities or malicious acts committed against them such as those already mentioned previously which had already happened here as well as those committed against them elsewhere like those at Basilica della Santissima Annunziata located within Santa Maria Novella Church complex within Florence or those that had already happened elsewhere around Italy such as those that had already taken place outside Rome including those at Basilica della Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini located at Porta Maggiore near Rome (which was built between 1732 – 1739 AD) or Montevergine Abbey (built between 1072 – 1089 AD) located near Benevento (both designed by architect Francesco Azzurri) while having survived some major disasters including numerous earthquakes like that one that struck on 26 December 26 December 1980 soon after Christmas Day had passed while some were struck on 9 August 1349 when another struck on 27 July 1943 while some were struck on 23 November 1980 while some were struck on 8 September 1997 while some were struck on 6 April 2009 while some were struck on 6 January 2016 while some were struck on 29 May 2016 while some were struck on 24 September 2016 while some were struck on 8 November 2016 while some were struck on 18 October 2017 while others include earthquakes like that one that occurred between 31 October 1571 until 1 November 1571 striking Naples devastating areas around Mount Vesuvius including Torre Annunziata striking areas around Mount Vesuvius itself striking areas around Pompeii striking areas around Vesuvius City striking areas around Naples striking areas around Pozzuoli striking areas north of Naples striking regions north of Naples including Torre Annunziata itself resulting in over three thousand deaths with thousands more missing assumed dead plus tens of thousands injured plus tens of thousands left homeless plus tens of thousands displaced
