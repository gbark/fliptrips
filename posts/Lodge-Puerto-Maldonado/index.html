The lodge is surrounded by an immense amount of wildlife and its aerial view allows you to spot animals from a distance. The lodge is located 100km from Cuzco and is situated in the town of Puerto Maldonado, which has an international airport. This lodge provides comfortable accommodations and delicious meals.</p><p>The lodge’s team offers their guests a unique experience that allows you to discover different parts of Peru and its rich culture. Some of their activities include: night floats, bird watching, excellent fishing, hiking and horseback riding. Their staff will help you plan out your trip and provide you with all the necessary information about your stay at Puerto Maldonado. The staff was very professional and knowledgeable about the area, wildlife and culture. They happily answered all my questions and provided great service throughout my stay.</p><p>I truly enjoyed my stay at Lodge Puerto Maldonado because it allowed me to explore a beautiful part of Peru while also supporting a local community by visiting local villages in the area to participate in their daily activities including cooking classes, visiting a school in one of the villages or even going on a mat weaving class with local women or learning how to create a songbird feeder out of a gourd bowl! I would recommend this place if you want to take it easy after your Inca Trail experience!</p><p>Inca Trail Hiking Tips:</p><p>If you have never been hiking before, be sure to take it easy during your hike so that your body can get used to it! It is recommended that you start training before hand so that your body gets used to being active every day for long periods of time! Like anything else in life, starting small allows you to progress into more challenging hikes! When I did my Inca Trail hike, I was able to do about 3-4 hours at a time but eventually was able find ways to increase my time on the trail as well as increase my elevation level on some obstacles by using some certain techniques!! I had never hiked before but was still able to complete this trek within 10 days!! Hiking poles are highly recommended if you are not use to hiking or have had any injuries that may cause pain when walking or running! They offer stability when climbing up hills as well as prevent muscle fatigue by providing some assistance when climbing up hills or stairs!! What time should I wake up? It depends on what pace YOU want but since there are many stops along the way where they offer delicious food (as well as water/tea) along with bathrooms (if needed), there is no need getting up early unless YOU want too!! If you like hiking early then be sure not miss breakfast because they only serve it until 9am!! How many hours do we walk each day? Since there are many stops for food/bathrooms/tea breaks along the way then it depends how long YOU want too!! There are no set times for stopping for lunch/dinner because again YOU decide what pace YOU like!!! How much time should I spend on breaks? Again this depends on YOU!!!! You can choose what pace YOU would like at YOUR own leisure!! When should I start packing? As soon as possible!!! Ladies might want something nice for dinner too so maybe pack that first then pack clothes second!!! Make sure everything has place inside your backpack so that everything fits!!! Don’t forget about putting toilet tissue inside one side pocket since they don’t always have bathrooms along he trail!!!! What type water bottle works best? A 32oz camelbak works great!!!!! Everyone else brought big Nalgene bottles so I decided against bringing one because it didn’t fit inside my backpack since most people have tents!!! Do NOT bring regular water bottles they are heavy!!!! What type clothes should I bring? Go light!!!! Bring pants with zip-off legs or shorts with zip-off legs because most nights there are cold breezes!!! Make sure whatever type pants you bring have pockets for toilet tissue if needed…. Jeans work great too…bring quick dry material…and prepare yourself for rain!!! Shoes…. tennis shoes work great but if u don’t own any make sure whatever shoes u bring u can slip off quickly.. Running shoes work good too…maybe even sandals….What kind toiletries should bring? Toothbrush &amp; toothpaste….hand sanitizer….shampoo &amp; conditioner…moisturizer…..sunscreen…lipbalm…small bar soap….. What type snacks should i bring? Granola bars &amp; protein bars :) How much money do we need?? $100-$150 per person per day depending upon how much stuff u buy along he way …..you can exchange money at bank near Plaza de Armas ;)</p><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"Lodge Puerto Maldonado","image":["https://heyletsgo.casa../../img/jungle/pexels-david-ria%C3%B1o-cort%C3%A9s-975771.jpg"],"author":"Gustaf Barkeling","genre":"TouristTrip","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gustaf Barkeling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/img/favicon/favicon-192x192.png?hash=2089033c93"}},"url":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Lodge-Puerto-Maldonado/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Lodge-Puerto-Maldonado/","datePublished":"2018-04-19","dateModified":"2021-11-21","description":"Lodge Puerto Maldonado is a breathtaking lodge set in the heart of the Madre de Dios region.
