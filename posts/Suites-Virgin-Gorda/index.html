The hotel consists of two adjacent buildings, each with its own lobby, pool, restaurant, and bar. The rooms are small but well appointed. The hotel is located across the harbor from the Westin and Little Dix Bay resorts. Scuba diving and sailboat charters are based at the nearby Yacht Harbour.</p><pre><code>		 				Little Dix Bay

		 				The Westin Resort ★★★ LUXURY RESORT Little Dix Bay is a collection of low-rise buildings scattered along miles of beachfront (with no beach), only one mile from the airport; it’s ideal for divers who don’t need to be on-site for early flights. The dining options range from an informal beach grill to one of the island’s best French restaurants (no surprise, given that chef Jean-Louis Palladin was the resort’s consulting chef until his death). The rooms are among Virgin Gorda’s largest, with large windows providing views over the nearby North Sound or out to sea; some have balconies or terraces with chairs to enjoy them.

In recent years, development has crept up around Cockburn Town and cruise lines have begun offering excursions here as well as in more remote areas such as West Bay and East End Bay—all within a few minutes of downtown by taxi or on foot. There is a visitor center on Main Street near Cockburn Town Harbour where you can get maps and information about Grand Turk attractions ranging from beaches to birding sites to offshore snorkeling sites full of colorful fish and coral reefs that tower more than 60 ft/20m above the surface (see “Snorkeling &amp; Scuba Diving,” below). In town you can also get fishing licenses—an excellent way for nonfishermen aboard ships not equipped with fishing gear or crew members not permitted to fish to try their hand at catching some amberjack, snapper, grouper, wahoo, tuna—even shark if you dare! It costs $5 per person per day for residents ($10 per day for nonresidents) and is good for 24 hours before sunset when you buy it. Fishing tours are also available through several operators in town (see “Guided Tours &amp; Excursions in Grand Turk Island” below). Other than that there isn’t much else in town except lots of souvenir shops selling T-shirts and trinkets aimed at tourists—the same ones you find in every port in every Caribbean island chain with one exception: Grand Turk does have its own branch of Tropicana Juice Factory so if you miss your Tropicana Orange Juice in your morning cereal back home there is no need to worry about that here! If you want something more substantial than frozen yogurt or ice cream bars look for “Kitty Kotch Market Place” which is near Kitty Kotch restaurant (see below), less than 5 minutes walking time out of town toward East End Bay but within walking distance of most cruisers staying in town. They serve breakfast here starting at 8am daily which includes fresh coffee made fresh daily by their resident barista! Kitty Kotch Market Place also offers sandwiches and an assortment of salads served all day long (they even make their own dressings fresh daily), plus hamburgers and hot dogs served until closing time (around 6pm) daily too! If you are staying on board your ship while docked at Grand Turk many ships will offer shoreside dining options ranging from sit-down meals at local restaurants to simple snacks available 24 hours a day which are usually located near tender stations so passengers can get off quickly after docking without having to walk too far away from ship berths during their stay ashore before getting back onboard again later that night once tenders have returned after last call! If your ship offers an optional gratuity package included during shoreside dining while docked here then consider adding an extra tip onto it if food service was excellent since waiters depend on them too since they make up almost all their income while working during this short stay period onboard Big Red Boat vessels sailing between here &amp; ports further down south along this side of Grand Bahama Bank including Half Moon Cay Bahamas! However do check any gratuities added onto the optional gratuity package offered onboard first because sometimes these optional tips included into these packages equal or exceed what waiters would normally receive anyway while working onboard cruise ships especially cruisers who purchase these optional tips offered onboard since they don't know how much waiters would normally receive anyway if they did not purchase this gratuity package offered onboard first! If your company offers complimentary tips then leave no less than 15% extra when paying your final bill which should include any tips already included into your bill either automatically by computerized bill program onboard or added manually by staff working during this short stay period when cruise ships temporarily anchor offshore waiting for next tender call time when passengers will be shuttled ashore using large passenger tenders capable holding hundreds of passengers riding between ship berths &amp; shoreline especially during high season when many people want to visit this port together onboard various ships visiting different ports including Turks &amp; Caicos Islands located just north across ocean waters along eastern side including Providenciales Island where most companies headquartered in Miami Florida USA home office reside including Carnival Cruise Lines whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #1 where all Carnival Cruise Line vessels homeport including Holland America Line whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #2 where all Holland America Line vessels homeport including Princess Cruises whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #3 where all Princess Cruises vessels homeport including Royal Caribbean International whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #4 where all Royal Caribbean International vessels homeport plus Norwegian Cruise Line whose headquarters resides right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #5 where all Norwegian Cruise Line vessels homeport plus Disney Cruise Line whose headquarters resides right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #6 where all Disney Cruises Ltd. vessels start sailing plus Carnival Corporation located along NW 4th Avenue just 2 blocks east south past downtown Miami International Airport located between NW 36th Street &amp;
