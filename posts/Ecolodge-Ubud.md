Ecolodge Ubud is a jawdropping ecolodge in Ubud. Nestled in the jungle, this place is like paradise on earth. It is the perfect place for a honeymoon or a getaway with friends and family. The atmosphere is very serene and relaxing. While staying here, you will enjoy stargazing, bird watching and swimming in the pool. There are lots of activities to do here like yoga and meditation classes and cooking classes!

The room we stayed in was very nice and comfortable. The beds were big with soft pillows and sheets! I really liked that there was a ceiling fan in the rooms to cool us off when it gets hot outside. You can see that they put a lot of effort into decorating each room to fit its theme. They have different types of rooms with different themes ranging from romance, yoga, wellness, etc.

They have a restaurant on-site called Damai Restaurant where you can enjoy fresh organic food for breakfast, lunch or dinner! I enjoyed their fresh juices so much!

We had dinner at their romantic restaurant called Antique Terrace Restaurant where they serve delicious food over looking the rice fields! This place is amazing at night when you look out over the rice fields while having dinner under their umbrellas near lanterns lit up by candles! We took lots of pictures here that night because the view was so pretty! You must try their signature dish called Lapis Legit which are steamed shrimp with steamed rice wrapped in banana leaf with coconut sauce & spices! It’s super delicious!! They also make great smoothies here if you want something healthier instead of dessert.

This place has free wifi near the reception area which makes it easy to communicate with your family back home or upload photos on Instagram/Facebook right away without needing any data pack since it’s faster than 3g/4g connection most times! Wifi is very important when planning your next vacation because sometimes things don’t go as planned while traveling but having wifi helps you stay connected with your loved ones back home even if you’re half way around the world while still enjoying your trip at its fullest!! We stayed here for one night but would love to come back again soon for longer stay next time!! Highly recommend this hotel if you ever visit Ubud!!
