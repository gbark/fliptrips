          Ecolodge Ubud is a breathtaking ecolodge nestled in the tropical foothills of the Annapurna range in Bali, Indonesia. It is an ideal place to unwind, relax and enjoy the natural beauty that surrounds it.

Nestled on a beautiful 2.5 acre property, our ecolodge features four serene swimming pools (one of which is only for adults), lush tropical gardens, an open-air dining room with stunning views of the Balinese countryside, and a colonial-style library with ceiling fans and rattan furniture.

This eco-friendly resort is popular with couples looking to spend their honeymoon in Ubud or honeymooners looking for a romantic getaway.
