Inn Naladhu is a rural inn and it's a great place to stay and chill out. The place is located near the famous Mookambika Temple and has its own private beach. This is a beautiful place and we had a great time here. The beach is beautiful, we enjoyed swimming and snorkelling there. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well as the manager. They arranged our trip to the Mookambika Temple by car, which was really nice of them as we didn't have any idea how to go there on our own. We were also very happy that they let us keep our vehicle in their garage for 2 days while we visited the temple, which was a great help since it would have been hard to find a place for our car there.



We stayed at their deluxe room, which was really nice and clean with AC, hot shower and tv. The room was facing the beach so you can enjoy nice views from your room as well as from the balcony where you could sit down for breakfast or dinner or just enjoy your coffee/tea during sunrise or sunset. I also liked the fact that they have no restaurant at their property but they have an arrangement with some local restaurants nearby so if you want to eat something other than vegetarian food you can do this easily without going outside of your hotel premises.



This place is good for couples but also families with kids would enjoy staying here as well because of its beautiful beach area and because of its proximity to Mookambika Temple (which has facilities for kids). View all 19 photos
