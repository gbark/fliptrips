Lodge Paradise Beach is a jawdropping lodge on the island of Nusa Lembongan, a tiny island off the coast of Bali. The lodge has three villas and a gorgeous pool overlooking the ocean. There is a private dock for swimming and snorkeling, as well as a private beach for relaxing on a day that you don’t feel like going to the other side of the island.

The three villas are each different from one another, but they all have an open air concept with an outdoor shower and breathtaking views. As if it couldn’t get any better, there is also a restaurant on site so you don’t have to wake up early to get breakfast or order room service – you can just enjoy it right there!
