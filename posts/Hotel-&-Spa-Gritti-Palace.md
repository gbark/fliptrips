          Hotel & Spa Gritti Palace is a gastronomical hotel & spa in the heart of Venice and in front of the Grand Canal.

Hotel Gritti Palace is in the historic centre of Venice and overlooks the Grand Canal. The hotel is within walking distance from Saint Mark's Square, Rialto Bridge and the most important events in Venice such as the film festival (Mostra del cinema di Venezia), Biennale (Biennale dell'Arte) and Carnival (Carnevale di Venezia). Hotel Gritti Palace is also within walking distance from Piazza San Marco, Saint Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace and Peggy Guggenheim Collection.

The hotel offers guests a unique experience: for its interior design, which combines Venetian style with modern art; for its restaurants; for its wine cellar; and for its spa area with an indoor swimming pool and gym. The spa area also offers a wide range of beauty treatments such as Ayurvedic massages, massage with essential oils or body scrubs.

The hotel has been renovated by designer Piero Lissoni between 2014-2016. The rooms reflect the essence of Venice through their design which combines classic furniture inspired by Venetian tradition with contemporary elements such as Murano chandeliers and Lucite chairs by Gio Ponti. Each room has a different colour theme: "Bianco Perla", "Blu", "Azzurra", "Tricolore" e "Rosso".
