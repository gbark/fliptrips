The one-bedroom suite has a king-size bed, a sofa bed in the living room, and a kitchenette. The two-bedroom suite has two bedrooms that share a bathroom (one bedroom has twin beds). Guests receive free access to the nearby Club de Playa Paracas (a beach club with bar, restaurant, pool, and gym), as well as use of beach equipment (such as umbrellas and chairs) at the beach.</p><p>Playa La Arena is 800m (1/2 mile) south of Paracas Bay’s center along Av. Tumbes; look for the large green sign.</p><p>$ Hotel San Martín is on Playa La Arena at Av. Tumbes 715; tel. 084/253-032; <a href="http://www.hotelsanmartinperu.com">www.hotelsanmartinperu.com</a>; $$$$. This hotel has spacious rooms with one king-size bed and a sofa bed in the living room; it also has two suites with king size beds including sofa beds in each room and kitchenettes — all offer balconies or terraces overlooking the sea — air conditioning, cable TV, telephone (with answering machine), Wi-Fi (free), minibar (not always stocked), safe deposit box (not always available), hair dryer, toaster, coffee maker or kettle for tea or hot chocolate — all included in the price! It also has an outdoor pool surrounded by lounge chairs and tables for drinks and snacks while you sunbathe. The restaurant serves breakfast for guests only: it’s not very good but it’s free so why complain? Guests receive free entrance to Club de Playa Paracas — which guests say isn’t worth it — use of beach equipment such as umbrellas and chairs on private beach at El Faro Beach Resort &amp; Spa just across from Hotel San Martín — which is much nicer than La Arena Beach Resort &amp; Spa right across from Hotel San Martín! One reviewer said that “the staff at this hotel was not very helpful especially when we wanted to visit Limón Beach in Paracas Bay area [15 km/9 miles south of Paracas]. We had to walk in sand in order to take pictures of sea lions swimming off shore…There are no facilities near this hotel…The only place where we found something was many kilometers away…The service was poor…[and] there was no hot water when we needed it [during our 5-night stay]. The food was not great but at least there were options [for breakfast]. It was nice [to have] free internet [included], good coffee [and good] Chilean wine [available from their wine list!]…One thing I did like about the hotel were their sunsets over the ocean!!! Overall I would not recommend this hotel because they do not have much to offer." Another reviewer said: “The place looked really nice online but looks can be deceiving...We stayed 2 nights...[at] $125 per night...[for] 1 bedroom suite...We stayed 2 nights 2 days...[and] spent most our time out side looking for other things to do since there were no other amenities around this place..." One guest wrote: "This guesthouse is located right next door to something called "Hotel La Arena". That's where I stayed 3 years ago while visiting Paracas National Park - some people may prefer that location since it's more central within walking distance of restaurants etc., but I preferred staying closer to some beaches instead." One couple wrote: "We weren't happy here at all! Our shower didn't work properly - some days cold water only - sometimes only hot water - sometimes both but weak pressure! We had one towel each when we arrived - even though they knew we were coming! They never cleaned our room while we were there even though they knew we were staying 3 days!" Another guest wrote: "The best thing about this place is its location on beautiful deserted sand dunes just above beautiful deserted beaches." And another said: "I would rather stay here than at Hotel La Arena across the street just because I prefer sand under my feet than concrete." So if you want sand under your feet then go here!"</p><p>$$$$+</p><p>Club de Playa Paracas</p><p>Club de Playa Paracas</p><p>$$$$+</p><p>Private Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p><p>$$$$+</p><p>La Arena Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p><p>$$$$+</p><p>El Faro Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p><p>$$$ Hotel Casa Blanca Inn is on Avenida Tumbes 646 between calles Edificio A y Edificio B in front of Club de Playa Paracas; tel./fax 084/253-039 or 084/253-039; <a href="http://www.hotelcasablancaperu.com">www.hotelcasablancaperu.com</a>; $$ . It offers three types of accommodations: Standard Room ($$) with 1 queen bed plus 1 single bed plus 1 bathroom plus kitchenette with mini fridge plus microwave plus TV plus Wi-Fi ($); Patio Room ($$) has 2 queen beds plus 1 single bed plus ceiling fan plus bathroom with tub plus kitchenette with mini fridge plus microwave plus TV plus Wi-Fi ($); Suite ($$$) includes 2 queen size beds or 1 king size bed + 1 single + ceiling fan + bathroom + kitchenette + TV + Wi-Fi ($). All rooms have laundry service available if you ask for it! Guests receive 10% discount off everything except spa services at nearby Aqua Salon Salon &amp; Spa located next door -- which guests say is very expensive anyway -- so don't bother going there! Guests get 50% off meals ordered from 6 pm–9 pm daily at Diego's Restaurant next door -- which guests say isn't worth going anyway -- so don't bother going there either!" Dining options include Diego's Restaurant -- known as one of Peru's best seafood restaurants -- which offers fresh seafood caught daily including oysters from local oyster farms as well as fruits such as mangoes grown locally on their own farm outside town. For those who don't like seafood they offer meat dishes such as pork sausage stewed in beer served over fried potatoes that one guest called "very tasty" and desserts such as flan made fresh every day that one reviewer said was "really good" but another said wasn't very good because she thought it was too sweet." They also have a full bar including premium imported beers such as Stella Artois ("good") served ice cold ("really cold!") by friendly bartenders ("better than friendly!") who love talking about beer ("okay"). Overall guests recommend eating here because food costs less than eating anywhere else; others don't recommend eating anything else except breakfast buffet offered morning until 11 am daily for $8 per person because it wasn’t worth paying more elsewhere even though reviewers complain that “the breakfast foods aren’t replenished often enough – waited half hour before seeing any foods replenished – long waits – food wasn’t worth waiting for – got sick after eating – probably due to all those flies flying around – saw waiter swatting flies away from trays holding food – yuk…. Also complained about insects flying around dining area – careful what you eat….One annoying thing about this resort is people trying push products on you regardless if you need them or not." Another reviewer wrote: "I'm scared inside this hostal!!! Not really scary inside but outside!! There are many dogs around here!! Bad dogs!!! The first night I couldn't sleep due those dogs barking....Very dangerous....They know where your car park your car....Most dangerous dog got into my car.....I could see him through my window.....I felt very scared.....He tried bite my car window....Those dogs bite!!!! After he bit my car window he left..... But still feel scared...... Also many insects inside hostal....Bed bugs inside sheets....Not rest well......Noisy outside cause by dogs barking.....Couldn't sleep.....I'll never come back again!!!" Some reviewers complained about having problems getting reservations between Christmas Day thru New Year's Day even though they made reservations months ahead before coming down." Overall reviewers say rooms are clean except rooms facing street side where cars drive up onto sidewalk disturbing peace by making lots of noise 24 hours a day 7 days a week including horn blowing?!?!? Pools are heated year round 24 hours per day making them perfect for swimming anytime regardless how cold it gets outside --- some called them excellent pools! Small pool area can be crowded some times especially during high season when everyone seems to hang out waiting out stormy weather leaving few lounge chairs available during stormy weather.... Still some reviewers thought pools weren't heated enough --- yet others recommended them calling them perfect temperature ---</p><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"Suites Paracas","image":["https://heyletsgo.casa/img/beach/pexels-pok-rie-383497-1920w.jpg"],"author":"Gustaf Barkeling","genre":"TouristTrip","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gustaf Barkeling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"/img/favicon/favicon-192x192.png?hash=2089033c93"}},"url":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Suites-Paracas/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://heyletsgo.casa/posts/Suites-Paracas/","datePublished":"2020-06-03","dateModified":"2021-11-21","description":"Suites Paracas is a sophisticated suites-only hotel with an upscale restaurant and bar, an outdoor terrace overlooking the ocean, and a..."}</script><p>Published <time datetime="2020-06-03">03 Jun 2020</time></p></article></main><footer><a href="/about/">About</a></footer></body></html>
