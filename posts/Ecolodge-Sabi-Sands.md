Ecolodge Sabi Sands is a private ecolodge located in the Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve in South Africa. As the only private luxury lodge situated inside the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, Ecolodge Sabi Sands is ideal for those wishing to explore the region on foot.

The rich diversity of the Sabi Sand ecosystem is home to an abundant variety of game including elephant, lion, cheetah, buffalo and leopard. Guests are able to explore the bush on foot or drive along our extensive network of dirt roads. The lodge offers an exclusive service for small groups which includes a personal guide who will accompany guests on game drives and walks to ensure their every wish is granted.

The heart of Ecolodge Sabi Sands consists of four uKhahlamba traditional rondavels set amongst lush indigenous forest overlooking a waterhole where elephants regularly come to drink. The four en-suite rondavels have been designed with both comfort and style in mind with ensuite bathrooms, underfloor heating and an open plan design that will ensure you never feel too far away from nature. No two rondavels are identical; each has its own individual character with huge picture windows allowing guests to enjoy uninterrupted views over this magical area.

There are also three spacious tented suites made from canvas and wood offering an experience not found anywhere else in South Africa today. Each tent has its own private decking area which overlooks the waterhole where game can be easily spotted; no decking area is ever shared with other tents. The style is rustic but comfortable; each tent features a double bed, comfortable lounges and stunning d√©cor throughout including hand-loomed floor coverings made by local women at Stony Plain Farm (a community initiative run by Ecolodge) located just outside Hazyview - approximately 20 minutes by road from Ecolodge Sabi Sands - as well as stunning traditional handmade furniture made locally using indigenous materials such as wickerwork, brickwork and woodcarvings sourced from local villages around Hazyview.
