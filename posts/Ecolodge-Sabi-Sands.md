          Ecolodge Sabi Sands is a rustic ecolodge located near the entrance of Kruger National Park, in Sabi Sand Wildtuin, South Africa.

The lodge is small and intimate with only six chalets. The rooms are simply decorated but comfortable. The bathrooms are shared and somewhat basic but spotless.

There is a large swimming pool with a big deck where you can relax after an evening game drive. There is also a bar and restaurant at the lodge.
