          Hotel & Spa Paracas is a sun-soaked hotel & spa set against the backdrop of the beautiful Paracas Bay. The property is located just ten minutes from the Paracas National Reserve, where you can admire the impressive remains of Paracas culture, which are said to be 2,000 years old. If you are not up for a long trip to see them, there are remains right at Hotel & Spa Paracas. Right near the hotel you will find an area with multiple burial places, which are called Huaca Ruins. The huaca ruins are quite popular among tourists who visit Hotel & Spa Paracas.

The huaca ruins are actually interesting buildings that hold tombs that were created by the Paracas people between 300 BC and 200 AD. The tombs were dug into hillsides or cut into rocks and then surrounded by walls made of mud bricks and reed mats. If you want to get a closer look at how they look like, we recommend taking a trip to Huaca Larga (Larga Pyramid) and Huaca de las Brujas (Huaca of Witches). You can also see some interesting cave paintings and there is even a small museum on site in one of the huacas.

The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous and when we got there we were blown away by how beautiful it was! One thing that immediately caught our attention was the big pool in front of it! It had such a great view of the ocean! Our second favorite thing about it was how close we were to all different types of restaurants and shops in town! We immediately wanted to go out for drinks at one of the many bars and restaurants nearby after checking in!

The restaurant and bar on-site at Hotel & Spa Paracas was definitely one our favorite things about this place! We went for dinner one night during our stay here and had such an amazing time! The food was so good here with lots of different options to choose from including an Italian menu, seafood options, steak options etc. etc. They also have live music every night so if you decide to go out for drinks while staying here you might get lucky enough to catch some live music too while enjoying your evening with some drinks. We loved it here so much that we actually went back a couple more times during our trip before leaving town which is pretty rare for us because we never want to eat anywhere twice during vacation haha but this place was just too good not to come back more than once while visiting Paracas Mexico ! We highly recommend checking out this restaurant/bar if you ever visit Hotel & Spa Paracas too !
