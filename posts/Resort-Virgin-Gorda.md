          Resort Virgin Gorda is a spiritual resort and we work with a number of spiritual teachers and healers. The goal of this work is to support each person to develop their own spiritual practice, whether they become involved in organized religion, or just do their own thing on their own terms. There is no pressure to join any group or attend any events.

The main teacher at the resort is John of God, a spiritual healer who treats people from all over the world at his healing center in Brazil. He has appeared on Oprah and CNN and has treated many celebrities including Madonna, Demi Moore and Elizabeth Taylor. His healing center treats over two million people per year and he has been featured in an Al Gore movie called “An Inconvenient Truth”. The movie features John working with a man who had terminal cancer but was completely cured by his treatments.
