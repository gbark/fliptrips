          Ranch Puerto Maldonado is a rustic ranch located in the Valley of Longevity, a mile from the Peruvian Amazon. We offer a unique experience as part of a sustainable community, where you can learn about our conservation efforts and daily life in the Amazon.

We have built a comfortable house on stilts with a great view of the river and surrounding nature. The house is fully equipped with kitchen, bathroom, living room and balcony. There is one double bed and a single bed, as well as mattresses on the floor for extra guests.

The wildlife around us is abundant with monkeys, parrots, butterflies and many types of birds. In addition to the birds there are also various types of snakes, lizards and frogs to be found in our garden. We have an aquarium where you can see piranhas! In addition to enjoying nature we also practice yoga on our beautiful terrace overlooking the river!
