Guest House Sandy Dunes is a romantic guest house with a stunning view of the Atlantic Ocean. It is located at the most northern tip of Barbados, in one of the most beautiful settings in the Caribbean.

The cottage has an open-plan living area with comfortable sofas, a dining table and fully equipped kitchen with granite counter tops. There are two bedrooms, one with a queen-size bed, and the other with twin beds. The master bedroom has an ensuite bathroom with bathtub and shower unit. There are two private covered verandas with rocking chairs overlooking the sea, perfect for watching spectacular sunrises or enjoying romantic sunsets.
