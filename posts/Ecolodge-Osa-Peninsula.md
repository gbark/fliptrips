Ecolodge Osa Peninsula is a rustic ecolodge on the Osa Peninsula. You can come here for a day or spend a few days and stay in one of the rustic cabins (some with bathrooms and some without), and enjoy hiking and wildlife viewing in the forest.

This is an excellent way to experience the forest and wildlife of Costa Rica. The lodge is near Punta Mona, which is a black sand beach that is great for swimming, snorkeling, and surfing (depending on ocean conditions).
