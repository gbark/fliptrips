Hotel Cipriani is a jawdropping hotel right on Piazza San Marco. It's luxurious, but not overly so. The breakfast buffet is worth the price of admission ($38/person), and the rooms are stunningly decorated.

Where to Eat in Venice

Venice has an abundance of local restaurants that are generally reasonably priced. However, there are also a few highly regarded "must-try" restaurants that are worth mentioning. These restaurants tend to be more expensive, but they're special for a reason, and you won't regret trying them at least once.

Osteria La Caravella is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the world. Located right on Campo Santa Margherita near Campo San Barnaba, La Caravella is one of the most well-known osterias in all of Italy. The food is ridiculously fresh and generally served family style (which makes it easy to share), and you can't beat that view! I have never had a bad meal here, and I have no doubt that this will continue to be my go-to place when I visit Venice in the future. Note: They do not take reservations, so only go if you're okay with waiting for a table! It's worth it though!

Osteria Enoteca Ai Artisti is another great option for eating out in Venice. It's located near Il Redentore church on Isola di San Michele (which was where we stayed during our trip). This osteria has lovely outdoor seating right on the water as well as indoor seating with traditional Venetian decor inside (including an old piano). The prices aren't too bad either – expect to spend around $20/person for lunch or dinner here (and $35/person for brunch). They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait if you want an outdoor table or come early if you want an indoor table – we waited less than half an hour both times we went there, and we ate late afternoon both times which is typically when many people eat lunch in Venice anyway! Highly recommend this restaurant – it's one of our favorites from our entire trip!

La Cantina della Birra Artusi is perhaps the most famous restaurant in all of Venice (at least according to TripAdvisor!) Located right on Campo Santa Margherita near Campo San Barnaba, Birra Artusi's claim to fame comes from its beer selection – they brew their own beer using sourdough yeast and serve it alongside traditional Italian food like risotto and handmade pasta that comes straight from their own kitchen (they don't use any pre-made sauces or pastas here). If you're looking for something simple like pizza or pasta though, Birra Artusi probably isn't your best bet since they specialize in more high-end traditional Italian dishes – but it's definitely a must-try if you want to try some local beers while visiting Venice! Note: You can also buy Birra Artusi beers from many other bars throughout Venice too – including at most bars right around Rialto Bridge which makes this restaurant a great stop after doing some sightseeing there! Also note: This restaurant can get quite busy during peak tourist season which means it may take a while before they can seat you – just look at them & smile though since they always seem happy anyway!
