          Guest House Paracas is a jawdropping guest house that is located right on the beach. Itâ€™s a super intimate setting and you canâ€™t beat the views. If you want to stay somewhere that is more private and exclusive, then this is the place for you. It is a bit more expensive than other guest houses along this stretch of beach, but itâ€™s definitely worth it.

The staff are all very friendly and accommodating so if you are traveling with kids or elderly people, I think you will feel comfortable here. This place also has free wifi which is always nice ðŸ™‚ The only downside I can think of would be that there isnâ€™t much to do around here after dark, but thatâ€™s not really an issue for me personally.

Overall, I would rate this place 4 out of 5 stars ðŸ™‚
