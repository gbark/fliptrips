          Safari Camp Pacuare is a breathtaking safari camp located in the rainforest of the Pacuare River. The camp is located on a fern-covered bank, surrounded by primary cloud forest (which is home to toucans, monkeys, parrots, and many other tropical birds) and overlooking the Pacuare River. The Pacuare River has multiple class IV+ rapids that attract rafters from around the world. Just outside the camp is Las Pumas Waterfall, which cascades down into a granite canyon filled with pools of cool fresh water.

The Camp Pacuare Lodge offers the finest accommodations in the area. All rooms are equipped with private bathrooms and hot water showers, air conditioning, ceiling fans, private balconies overlooking the river and surrounding rainforest, direct phone service to US & Canada, satellite televisions with DVD players (located in all rooms), complimentary Wi-Fi access throughout the lodge & pool bar area (no charge for Wi-Fi), hair dryers (located in all rooms), refrigerators available at no cost to guests (available at reception desk), three single beds or one king bed per room as well as a ceiling fan and large private balcony overlooking the river and surrounding rainforest.

Traveling to this camp from San José can be done by either road or river via boat. By road it takes about 5 hours from San José to reach La Fortuna/Arenal area on Route 32 which is about 100 km away from Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí on Route 121 where you continue your journey upstream on a boat for an additional 5 hours on a motorized canoe or a smaller motorized boat called a lancha to Camp Pacuare Lodge which will take you another 15 minutes of motoring upriver from Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí where you will need to carry your luggage for about 50 meters through lush tropical forest before reaching Camp Pacuare Lodge.

The average temperature is 84°F/29°C year round with an abundance of rainfall during each month of the year with its wettest months being September – November when it often rains daily for two hours or more each day. Temperatures can drop down below 60°F/16°C at night even during its dry season however a hot shower or soaking in one of its three pools will warm you back up quickly anytime during your stay at this luxury adventure lodge that borders both Costa Rica's Arenal Volcano National Park as well as La Amistad International Park that shares territory with Panama's Chagres National Park which protects an enormous expanse of tropical rainforest wilderness that abounds in exotic flora and fauna not found anywhere else in Central America including tapirs and jaguars as well as many endemic species such as hummingbirds, poison dart frogs etc...
