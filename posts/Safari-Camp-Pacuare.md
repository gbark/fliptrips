Safari Camp Pacuare is a spiritual safari camp on the banks of the Pacuare River, near Turrialba. It is located in the central valley of Costa Rica, about 1 hour and 15 minutes' drive from San Jose. It is an ideal base for adventure tourists looking to explore the surrounding area on foot or horseback.

The Pacuare river is famous for its magnificent white water rafting, kayaking and tubing. The river is known as one of the best rafting rivers in Costa Rica. The rapids are relatively easy with few rocks or overhead dangers on this section of the river that flows through the rain forest. There are three different levels of difficulty on this trip ranging from Class II to Class IV rapids, with a total drop of more than 80 feet in elevation during a descent of 4 miles (6Â km). This section of river is also suitable for novice rafters. The guided rafting tours include transportation from San Jose Airport or San Jose hotels or you can drive yourself to the Pacuare River Valley by car rental, taxi or minibus shuttle service from hotels in San Jose.

Safari Camp Pacuare offers both private and group white water rafting trips with full services including hotel pick-up & return at any location in San Jose area, 2 meals per day prepared by professional chefs and bilingual guides/cooks who will provide you with lots of information about flora and fauna as well as colorful legends about animals and natural wonders along the river tour route..
