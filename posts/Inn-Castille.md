          Inn Castille is a breathtaking inn on a hilltop on a quiet, safe street. The inn is just steps away from the main entrance to the city's historic district and within walking distance of many restaurants. It's also close to the convention center and the area where street musicians perform.

The inn has three levels - an outdoor terrace, lobby area, and restaurant. There are plenty of tables to sit at in the downstairs restaurant. We chose to eat breakfast downstairs for two mornings, so we could eat outdoors both times. This was one of our favorite parts of the stay. The views were spectacular! Breakfast was good enough to keep us coming back for more each day.
