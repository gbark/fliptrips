          Private Island Zighy Bay is a sun-soaked private island resort, set on a tranquil bay in the heart of The United Arab Emirates.

In this idyllic setting, imagine the perfect tropical escape – white sand beaches, crystal clear waters and warm sunny days. On Island Zighy Bay, guests can find all three in abundance.

Guests can choose between accommodation options on the island or on the mainland, where selection includes villas and suites at the resort’s sister property, The St. Regis Dubai.

The St. Regis Dubai boasts an outdoor pool and tennis court with private beach access as well as private drivers for transportation to and from the airport during your stay at Island Zighy Bay. It is just a short drive away from the resort itself by boat or by car overland.
