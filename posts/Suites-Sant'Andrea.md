          Suites Sant'Andrea is a historical suites residence in the heart of the city. It is located in a 16th-century palace that was once home to a noble family from Mantua, and later to the Austrian governors. The interior has been completely restored to accommodate guests who come to visit Venice for business or leisure. Part of the property, which was built around an internal courtyard, is one of the few palaces that can be seen by tourists (the most famous of which is Ca' d'Oro).

The residence consists of 40 apartments; each has its own character and charm. Some are more modern than others, but all are comfortable and decorated with precious furnishings and paintings dating back several centuries. There are no large buildings around this residence (other than historical ones), making it an oasis of peace in the heart of Venice. Guests will enjoy their stay after discovering the numerous bars, cafes and restaurants located within walking distance.
