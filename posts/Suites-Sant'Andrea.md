Suites Sant'Andrea is a romantic suites situated in a beautiful old building, recently renovated. The rooms are furnished with antiques and the bookshelves are filled with a variety of interesting books. The garden is very nice and perfect for relaxing. It's situated in front of the castle of Urbino, so you can watch the tourists going up and down that steep road. There is a great restaurant just below the hotel, which serves excellent food. And there is also a bus stop just outside for exploring Urbino by public transportation. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Urbino!
