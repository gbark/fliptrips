Travel Style Camps: Glamping and Luxury Camps

Glamping is a trend that has been gaining popularity over the last decade or so. The idea behind glamping is being able to experience nature but with all of the comforts of home. That usually means having a comfortable bed with sheets and blankets as well as some form of electricity such as a hot shower or warm lighting at night. Some glamping options do not have any electricity but instead use candles or fireplaces for light at night along with solar showers for water needs during the day. Glamping can be done in tents or cabins made out of re-purposed materials such as shipping containers or wooden structures found locally in nature preserves around the world or brought in by truck from home base or an off-site location where it was built specifically for use by the campers. Some camps offer glamping options while others don't so bear this in mind when choosing your desired level of comfort while living in nature. Luxury camps are similar but often more like hotels than glamps with amenities like air conditioning, laundry service etc… You can find luxury camps with varying degree's of luxury though they are often quite expensive due to their size and number of amenities offered on site (and sometimes off site). This is another option that should be given serious consideration before deciding on which type of camp is right for your trip!
