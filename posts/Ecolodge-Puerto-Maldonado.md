          Ecolodge Puerto Maldonado is a spiritual ecolodge, built to preserve the rainforest and respect the environment. We offer a peaceful, natural and healthy stay in the rainforest, as well as an incredible experience of learning to live with nature. Our cabins are surrounded by a wide variety of native plants and flowers, as well as fruit trees created by our own hands.

The main purpose of this ecolodge is to preserve the environment and biodiversity that we have here in Puerto Maldonado. We wish to share this experience with you and teach you about our culture through daily activities: yoga, meditation, reiki, kundalini yoga.

We hope that you enjoy your stay with us!
