          Safari Camp Yasuni National Park is a pristene safari camp located in the Yasuni National Park, a unique expanse of pristine rainforest bordering the Amazon River in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

The Yasuni National Park is one of the most biodiverse areas on Earth. It contains a hectare of rainforest for every person living in Ecuador and is home to a staggering amount of species, including jaguars, pink river dolphins, tapirs and more than 1,000 bird species.

The camp itself is located within the park borders and only accessible by plane or boat. The camp itself is comprised of six adobe cabins set on stilts above the forest floor and offers guests stunning views from each cabin’s wraparound veranda. The Yasuni National Park also houses a research station run by the government’s Ministry of Environment as well as an indigenous village (Yanoama).

The camp’s guides are all bilingual (English/Spanish) and offer guests an unparalleled experience into this lush rainforest environment – whether it be for fishing expeditions on the Amazon River, swimming with pink river dolphins or spotting wildlife at dawn and dusk – safari camp Yasuni National Park provides an authentic experience into such a unique corner of Ecuador.
