Safari Camp Yasuni National Park is a jawdropping safari camp inside Yasuní National Park and home to a spa and a spectacular view over the river and the rainforest.

Yasuní National Park is home to some of the most unique species on the planet after it was declared a biosphere reserve in 1979. It’s also home to some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, such as flooded forests, marshes, savannahs and cloud forests.

Yasuni National Park is one of the most biodiverse places on Earth, with 75% of flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world. The park also has one of Latin America’s largest populations of indigenous peoples who have lived in the area for several centuries. There are over 16 different ethnic groups represented throughout this vast expanse of wilderness.

The park is also considered an important center for sustainable development by protecting both culture and nature. The park boasts an impressive array of mammals including tapir, jaguar, giant anteater, manatee, capybara, giant river otter, pacarana (a large rodent), three-toed sloth and armadillo among many others. As well as being an excellent place to see birds including macaws, toucans, hummingbirds and trogons you can also spot caiman lizards among other reptiles here.
