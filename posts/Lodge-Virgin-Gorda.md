          Lodge Virgin Gorda is a rustic lodge, located on the north side of Virgin Gorda, near the Valley church. The resort is known for its private beach and cliff-side hot tubs which offer excellent views of the entire island.

Accommodations at this resort are set in wooden cottages with screened windows and doors, offering maximum ventilation. Each cottage has a private balcony with hammock, offering additional relaxation space. The rooms at this resort are decorated in Caribbean style but with modern amenities including air conditioning, ceiling fans, flat-screen TVs and wireless internet access. Each room has hardwood flooring and hand carved furnishings in keeping with the rustic theme of the property.

The resort is set across about 80 acres of waterfront land on the north coast (Virgin Gorda is an island split into two halves) and guests can explore beautiful sandy beaches lapped by gentle seas or enjoy watersports on the calm waters of North Sound Bay. Guests can also take advantage of day trips to explore nearby islands such as Anegada which offers great snorkeling (where you may see coral reefs, sponges and sea turtles) or Jost Van Dyke (the next island along) where you can swim in natural rock pools or play golf on one of the worldâ€™s most scenic courses.
