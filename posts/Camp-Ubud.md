          Camp Ubud is a romantic camp site surrounded by a landscaped garden. It is the perfect place for honeymooners and couples who want to relax and enjoy a romantic atmosphere.

The Camp Ubud is a small family resort located in the centre of Ubud, close to the busy shops, restaurants and galleries. The Camp Ubud offers two types of accommodation: standard room with private bathroom and deluxe room with private bathroom. We also have a beautiful swimming pool. The swimming pool is surrounded by a landscaped garden where you can enjoy your breakfast at the poolside or in the restaurant beside it! In our restaurant we have an extensive breakfast buffet served daily from 6:00 till 10:00. For lunch and dinner we offer a la carte menu which you can choose from in our restaurant or take away in a picnic basket to enjoy in your room or in one of the many nice restaurants nearby!

The Camp Ubud is located just steps from the central square of Ubud, where you can find many nice shops, restaurants and galleries. On Sundays there is an Art Market which attracts lots of local people selling their own artwork! At night there are many activities going on around this square such as traditional dance shows, cultural shows, live music or Balinese puppet shows! So if you like nightlife then Ubud will be perfect for you; if not then we will give you some nice suggestions for romantic dinner locations and after dinner activities such as bike rides to rice terraces, romantic walks along the river and much more…

Make sure to visit one of Bali’s best museums ‘Museum Puri Lukisan’; it houses one of Bali’s largest collections of paintings by local artists such as I Gusti Nyoman Lempad (father of Balinese painting), I Gusti Ketut Surya (father-in-law) and I Wayan Dibia (son). The museum also has other artifacts that are related to culture such as bronze statues, traditional drums etc…. If you like museums then don’t miss out on visiting ‘Museum Pura Luhur Batukaru’ which museum has carvings from all over Bali including stone inscriptions about ancient weaponry. There are also other museums located near Camp Ubud such as Museum Pura Taman Saraswati (temple), Museum Monkey Forest (monkey sanctuary) etc… so if museums are your thing then don’t miss out on visiting them while staying with us!
