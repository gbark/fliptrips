          Inn Madikew Game Reserve is a remote inn with cozy cottages, including a family suite with a loft, all built around a central pool. The inn is surrounded by forest and savanna, an environment that’s home to buffalo, zebra, giraffe, warthogs, kudu, bush buck and many other animals.

The lodge has its own water hole, which attracts large herds of animals. Game drives are available in the late afternoon and evening after sunset. Both day and night game drives are conducted to maximize sightings of animals in their natural habitat.

Accommodations at Madikew Game Reserve are very comfortable with four-poster beds and verandas for each cabin. Guests can enjoy meals under the stars while listening to the sounds of the African night air.

Madikew Game Reserve features high quality wildlife viewing with an emphasis on small mammal species such as porcupines, genets, civet cats and mongooses. Birding is also excellent here thanks to the large number of birding trails available at Madikew Game Reserve. There are over 1 000 bird species in South Africa alone! The lodge is located very close to Kruger National Park (less than one hour’s drive away).
