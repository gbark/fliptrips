Camp Paracas is a rustic campground located on the southern shore of Paracas Bay on the Pacific coast in the Paracas District of Peru. It is a small campground with a relaxed atmosphere situated directly on the sand, close to the beach. It is a great place for swimming and sunbathing. The campground has several shaded tables and benches providing a great place to relax, eat some food, and take in the views of Paracas Bay. Camping sites are located right along the sand, with some sites even having a little green space providing a bit more privacy between visitors. There are no restroom or shower facilities at this campground, however there is an outhouse located up from the beach with running water and stocked with toilet paper.

The campground is located close to several local restaurants and shops where you can buy basic food supplies such as bread, milk, juice and even beer if you so desire. There is also a small convenience store called ‘Aleman’ which sells basic toiletries such as soap and toothpaste. A short walk up from Aleman you will find ‘El Aleman’ restaurant which serves both breakfast and lunch daily with great sea views from their outdoor patio dining area.
