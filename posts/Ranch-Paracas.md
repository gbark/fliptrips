Ranch Paracas is a spiritual ranch, where guests are invited to connect with the spiritual energy of the location, in order to have a more meaningful experience.

"Paracas is a mystical place, it is very special. It has good energy because of its history, culture and nature," says Andrea. "This place is in my heart, in my blood."

Paracas offers the opportunity to have an authentic experience in one of South America's most beautiful places, in a natural setting that includes wild horses, stunning sunsets and the bright stars of the Southern Hemisphere.
