Peru’s White City

The “White City” is located in the city of Cusco, which is one of Peru's most famous cities. It has been named ‘the white city' because its buildings were built using natural materials such as stone and clay. The city was founded on top of a mountain, which was an important religious center for Inca culture and used to be part of their sacred capital, Cusco. There are many things to see in Cusco such as: beautiful churches, museums and interesting markets where they sell different kinds of food and artisan products that still preserve their original recipes from ancient civilizations such as: Inca and pre-Inca cultures.
