          Guest House Ocean View is a sun-soaked guest house, with a great location in the centre of Plettenberg Bay. It's close to many restaurants and shops, and only a few minutes walk to the beach.

Budget accommodation for backpackers, families or groups of friends. Very well equipped kitchen.

A small garden with a braai (barbecue) patio is at your disposal, as well as an outside shower. Free WiFi internet access is available in all areas - including the garden area!

The house has two bedrooms - both with double beds. The main bedroom also has an additional single bed, so can accommodate three adults comfortably...or up to four children. The second bedroom has two single beds. All rooms have mosquito nets for your comfort.
