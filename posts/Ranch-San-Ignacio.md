          Ranch San Ignacio is a breathtaking ranch in the high desert of the historic Gadsden Purchase area. I have been going to this ranch with my family since I was a child.

It is a place of warmth and friendship, where I have memories of horse rides, swimming in the clear water of a deep pool, and sitting by a campfire late into the night with friends and family.

In addition to being my favorite childhood vacation spot, this ranch is special because it was purchased from the proceeds of my father’s life insurance. It is a vivid reminder that my father is watching over me from heaven. My father’s spirit lives on in this amazing ranch!
