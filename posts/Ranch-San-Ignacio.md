Ranch San Ignacio is a spiritual ranch; we offer a safe haven to those who are looking for a refuge and refuge is what they will find. The ranch is located in the northern part of the state of Chihuahua, near the town of Mexicali, Baja California. It is open to those who want to experience one of the most powerful and profound healings that exist on this earth: shamanic healing.

The word san means holy and ignacio means saint so san ignacio is holy saint, or sacred healing. We work with many different lineages of shamans all over the world and we honor them all. Our intent is to provide a space for you to connect with your own healing power and discover your own truth and your own connection with God and nature. We offer traditional ceremonies as well as modern shamanic ceremonies that include: ayahuasca, yopo, huachuma, mapacho (ayahuasca vine), sanango (içana), chacruna (chacruna), datura, trompeta (trompetilla), yaje tinshu tusama, tiperuna tinshu tusama , pajaritos de la montaña (little mountain birds) , mihkalimpa , icimapa .

We also practice reiki, crystal therapy, massage therapy , sound therapy with crystal bowls , craniosacral therapy , bioenergetics therapy, intuitive readings by Tarot cards or cards from other traditions . We have an organic farm where we grow medicinal herbs, organic vegetables and medicinal plants. You can become familiar with these plants during our traditional ceremonies. We have animals on our ranch where people can experience being in contact with animals in their natural environment. There are horses for riding lessons or just plain fun! Dogs that love to play fetch or just lie quietly at your feet while you nap! Cats that will curl up next to you while you meditate! We have chickens so you can learn about eggs from birth until they are ready for breakfast! And there are also goats if you want milk fresh from the goat’s udder or maybe cheese made by yourself!

We have a beautiful swimming pool where one can relax after a full day of activities…or even before breakfast! Next year there will be hot tubs too because after working hard during ceremonies it feels great to relax in hot water; this heals physically as well as spiritually now doesn’t it? And now imagine this pool surrounded by trees covered with flowers like magnolias blooming pink flowers at the same time as orange jasmines…don’t try too hard…you will see…it’s magic! This place exists because all these things exist within us; it exists within each one of us; it exists within everyone . It exists because it is our natural state….this space created during ceremonies serves as a bridge between our inner world and our outer world….between ourselves and nature….between ourselves and God…because everything that exists outside ourselves exists within ourselves….and this bridge has been created out of love…and love heals . Come explore this bridge together; experience the magic together; live the magic together ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Welcome Home!!!
