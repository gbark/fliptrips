Ranch San Ignacio is a spiritual ranch; we offer a safe haven to those who are looking for a refuge and refuge is what they will find. The ranch is located in the northern part of the state of Chihuahua, near the town of Mexicali, Baja California. It is open to those who want to experience one of the most powerful and profound healings that exist on this earth: shamanic healing.

The word san means holy and ignacio means saint so san ignacio is holy saint, or sacred healing. We work with many different lineages of shamans all over the world and we honor them all. Our intent is to provide a space for you to connect with your own healing power and discover your own truth and your own connection with God and nature. We offer traditional ceremonies as well as modern shamanic ceremonies that include: ayahuasca, yopo, huachuma, mapacho (ayahuasca vine), sanango (içana), chacruna (chacruna), datura, trompeta (trompetilla), yaje tinshu tusama, tiperuna tinshu tusama , pajaritos de la montaña (little mountain birds) , mihkalimpa , icimapa .
