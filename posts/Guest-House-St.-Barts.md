Guest House St. Barts is a breathtaking guest house located in a converted boathouse on the island of St. Barts. An interior design haven, Guest House St. Barts is a serene retreat for those seeking a quiet, luxurious getaway from the fast pace of city life. The island’s pristine beauty is highlighted by its natural landscape, including white-sand beaches and azure waters; the guest house was built with this in mind, using natural materials like wood and stone to create an elegant but understated space.

The guest house is located in Gustavia, an old harbor town that’s rich in history; it was once home to privateer Jean Jacques Dessalines d’Orléans (a French military officer who later became governor of Saint-Domingue—modern day Haiti). The property has views of Mount Pelée and the sea; inside, the walls are lined with bookshelves filled with art books and travel guides. The guest house has three bedrooms with king-sized beds, each with an en suite bathroom featuring heated floors and outdoor showers. The living room has two sofas facing each other across a coffee table flanked by two chairs; guests can sit by the fireplace or outside on the terrace to enjoy spectacular views of Gustavia Bay.

The kitchen boasts custom Italian cabinetry and top-of-the-line appliances; it also has a dining table for four so guests can enjoy meals together while taking in sweeping views of St. Barts’ shoreline or reading their favorite books from Guest House St. Barts’ expanding library collection. A separate building houses three additional spacious suites featuring king-sized beds that are separated from each other by wood partitions that allow for privacy while allowing guests to mingle during meals or drinks at night on the terrace overlooking Gustavia Bay—the perfect spot to watch sunsets while sipping sangria or champagne!
