![Lodge San Ignacio](../../img/jungle/pexels-arthouse-studio-4534200.jpg)

Lodge San Ignacio is a charming lodge that sits on the edge of a lake, just a short drive from the main plaza. The lodge has a restaurant that serves an excellent breakfast. The rooms are simple and comfortable, and come with a private bath. For those wanting more privacy, there are three lakeside cabins available.

Hotel Casa QuetzalHOTEL $$

( GOOGLE MAP ; %505-832-5455; www.casatezal.com; Callejon El Dragon 10; s/d US$50/60; aW)

Although it's not as luxurious as some of the other hotels in town, this small hotel is immaculately clean and features large rooms with comfortable beds and cable TV. Rooms include mini-fridges and coffeemakers, but there is no hot water for showers – you have to wait until the next day to take one.


Hotel TikiHOTEL $$

( GOOGLE MAP ; %505-832-7102; www.hoteltikichicagodecostarica.com; Calle del Sol 7; s/d US$78/89; aW)S

The biggest hotel in town has spacious, high-ceilinged rooms with wooden floors and great views of nearby Laguna de Istmina from the upper floors. Rooms are decorated with folk art and include coffeemakers, mini-fridges and cable TV – none have hot water for showers or sinks though (there's only cold). It has an inviting pool area surrounded by greenery with hammocks to lounge in – perfect for lazing around after a day of exploring nearby sites like Xplor or Xcaret (located about 30km away).


oPosada del ÁngelCABIN $$$

( GOOGLE MAP ; %555-834-2490; www.posadadelangelcostarica.com; Carretera Tulumática Km 9; d incl breakfast US$200, 2 person per extra day US$30)S

About 2km north of town off Hwy 307 (the road to Río Lagartos), this remote tropical retreat is located on 5 hectares of private reserve bordering Laguna de Istmina National Wildlife Refuge – ideal for birding! Three spacious cabins have hardwood floors, balconies facing the lake side or gardens, fully equipped kitchens and screened windows so you can sleep peacefully even when jungle critters are chirping outside your door at night!


5Eating & Drinking


There are several basic sodas near the main plaza offering cheap eats such as tortillas (filled tortillas), sandwiches, eggs or hamburgers for about Q15 each – they're open during daylight hours only though so keep that in mind if you're looking to grab dinner late at night here. There are several upscale restaurants downtown serving international cuisine as well as local fare including seafood ranging from Q100 to Q150 per dish – expect higher prices during festivals like Semana Santa (Easter Week), Fiestas Patronales (in September) or other special events when all hotels increase their rates by 50%. Drinking establishments range from rough cantinas where locals drink beer out of buckets off tables made out of tree branches used as benches to upscale places where foreigners can order fancy cocktails for upwards of Q150 each!


8Information


Banco de Costa RicaBANK ATM(Calle del Sol)ATM accepting Visa cards only but no changes given on withdrawal made using ATMs linked to international networks like Cirrus or Plus etc.. No fee charged though so still better than changing money at home before coming here! There’s another ATM located inside Banco Nacional near the main plaza where both domestic cards like Visa Plus work fine too without any fee changes made using them either…excellent news!


Centro de SaludMEDICAL SERVICES( GOOGLE MAP ; %505-832-5111 ext 2400)This small clinic comes equipped with two doctors who also speak English but there’s not much they can do without access to medical supplies which rarely happens since most supplies come via airplane along with patients needing them flown out due to lack of medical facilities in Chiapas state…so don’t expect much here beyond first aid treatment unless you’re suffering from something minor like diarrhea! Here’s hoping better things will come along soon! There’s another small medical clinic located inside Hotel Posada del Ángel that charges Q50 per consultation…good luck getting seen quickly if you start suffering any major health issues while staying there!
