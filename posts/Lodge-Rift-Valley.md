          Lodge Rift Valley is a ecological lodge located in the Aberdares National Park, on the slopes of Mount Longonot. It has been called "the most successful tourist project in Kenya." It was opened by the founder of the Kenya Wildlife Service, George Adamson. The lodge is a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World and Relais & Ch√¢teaux.

Lodge Rift Valley was founded by George Adamson, a British conservationist known for his work with lions and for having portrayed himself as "Greystoke" in a series of Tarzan movies. In 1959, he moved to Kenya from Tanganyika, which was then a British colony. In 1961, he started to work with Elsa, a lioness whom he had taken from Nairobi National Park after she had been shot for killing goats at a nearby farm. He named her Elsa after Elsa von Trapp from The Sound of Music, and she became the first lioness to be successfully "tamed" and domesticated in Africa (some female lions were known to be kept as pets by African kings).
