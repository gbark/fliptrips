Lodge Rift Valley is a isolated lodge in the game that you can visit. It is located in the Rift Valley area in Africa.

Layout Edit

It has a well-equipped laboratory, a store, and three bungalows. There are also three NPCs than can talk to the player: two scientists and the owner, who you must find to unlock the store.

There are three bungalows available for rent for $350 each week. The NPC Scientist appears when you rent one of them after finding him in this location. You can also buy food, weapons or ammunition from the owner once he unlocks his store. One of his best selling weapons is the AK-47 with 1000 rounds for $1500 total. He can sell armor and attachments too but they're not as good as what you can find at other locations in Africa. There are also three crates near the bungalows that contain random loot such as ammo or guns but this loot will respawn two weeks after it's collected thus making it risky to collect if other players are nearby since they may get mad if they see you collecting another players loot! Be very careful when collecting these crates! If you decide to take one of these crates outside of this area do not bring it back inside because you'll lose it forever since it will be considered stolen property! There are no survivors here except for an NPC called Scientist that appears after renting one of the bungalows or killing all of them then approaching him while aiming a gun at him while he's lying on ground dead. The scientist has a unique skin which is black instead of white so he's different from other survivors encountered during your journey through Africa! Scientists have their own unique clothing which looks really cool so they're perfect for wearing while playing multiplayer with other players! If you decide to go inside one of these bungalows be aware that there's no bed here! Also beware that there's no toilet either so therefore there's no option to sleep or poop here! Scientists have their own unique clothing which looks really cool so they're perfect for wearing while playing multiplayer with other players! If your character has diarrhea then it is advised that you leave this area immediately because there's nothing here that will cure it and if your character dies from this disease then you'll be forced to respawn back at camp and lose some days worth of supplies such as food and water which is very annoying since dying from disease is avoidable by simply staying away from places like this where there aren't any toilets or medicine stations available at all! This is why this place isn't recommendable by many players who prefer places like Fort Knocks instead because Fort Knocks has toilets and medicine stations where characters with diarrhea can get cured without risking their lives by trying out risky actions such as camping here in Rift Valley where there aren't any toilets or any way to cure diarrhea whatsoever! So remember that staying away from areas like this during your journey through Africa will save lots of time and resources such as food and water since dying from diarrhea means losing multiple days worth of supplies which may result in starvation if enough time passes by without encountering any supplies on your way towards Capital City so always remember to stay away from places like these until reaching Capital City where all resources respawn but only during night time when nobody else will see your character doing something smelly like using a toilet in public because using a toilet in public isn't allowed otherwise people might think your character is mentally retarded since toilets aren't meant for public use but only at home where nobody except members of your household can see what's going on inside a toilet bowl if someone actually uses one which isn't recommended either due to health reasons but still some people may try out things like that just to avoid going outside during night time when nobody else will see them doing something smelly inside a toilet bowl which could result in getting killed instantly if done outdoors because scavengers hate seeing people doing smelly things outdoors especially during night time when scavengers roam around looking for fresh meat to eat without taking too much risks by hunting humans during daytime cause if someone sees scavengers eating humans then maybe humans will try attacking them causing scavengers being mauled by angry humans thus starving themselves because humans won't give up easily on killing scavengers who hunt humans just for fun among themselves causing scavengers being mauled badly by angry humans causing scavengers becoming weaker while some might even die due to lack of proper nourishment while some others might even go insane being mauled too badly among themselves causing insanity among survivors if enough time passes by yet again causing more chaos among survivors including innocent bystanders resulting into deaths caused by insane mauling survivors along with civilians including children thus creating chaos among civilians including children resulting into
