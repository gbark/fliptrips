Inn di Carpiano is a rustic inn, situated on a hill about 50 km from Bergamo. The inn is located in the hamlet of Carpiano, a small settlement at the foot of Monte Corno, a mountain about 1477m high, covered by the “Alta Val Brembana” National Park. The surrounding area is mainly agricultural, but also includes forests and picturesque valleys.

The area has many interesting places to visit:

– Lanzo d’Intelvi (12 km) is an old village with narrow streets and small squares where you can still see medieval houses; it is well known for its cheese specialities;

– Arona (15 km) is an old town on the banks of Lake Maggiore; it has well preserved medieval walls and represents an important centre for trade and industry;

– Lecco (30 km), well known for its lake views and famous for its salt mines; here you can admire the impressive Castello Baradello, built in 1205 during the reign of Enrico III; to reach it you have to take the cable car that connects Lecco to Colico (1 hour);

– Bergamo (50 km), “the city of hills” where you can enjoy typical dishes like polenta, rice with mushrooms or ravioli stuffed with spinach or ricotta cheese; to reach Bergamo you need to descend 428 metres along Corso Francia street.
