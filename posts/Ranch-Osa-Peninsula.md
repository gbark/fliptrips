          Ranch Osa Peninsula is a breathtaking ranch with an incredible view of the Osa Peninsula and the many virgin beaches and estuaries. The property is located in the area of Garza, about 40 minutes from Puerto Jimenez on a well maintained dirt road. It is recommended to use a 4 by 4 vehicle and travel with a local guide as there are no street signs and it is easy to get lost on this unpaved road.



This ranch has approximately 350 hectares of land, including some pastureland, some old cashew trees and about 50 hectares of mangroves. The property extends from the ocean to the rainforest with over 4000 ft of pristine coastline featuring several beaches. There are several estuaries that provide access to sea turtle nesting sites.



The ranch house has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, large kitchen/dining area and living room with hammock seating areas on each side for sitting back after a day exploring the Osa Peninsula. There is an open air kitchen outside under an overhang with seating for eating or relaxing while watching the sunsets or whale watching in season. There are also 2 additional houses on the property - one for staff quarters and one for guests that could be rented out separately if desired (see below).



The current owners have started to develop trails along the beach/rainforest areas but would like to continue developing this into a sustainable eco-tourism project or possibly build an eco-resort or eco-lodge on site - please contact us if you are interested in building something here! An "eco-tourism" model would be great as it would provide local employment opportunities while also providing income through renting out the guest house/hut & cabanas - please contact us if you are interested in building something here!



The Osa Peninsula provides some amazing wildlife viewing opportunities for those who love nature & adventure! It boasts more than 375 species of birds, 300 species of mammals (including Jaguars), 100 species of reptiles & amphibians, 300 species of butterflies & many other species that call this area home. There are several beautiful estuaries where you can go snorkeling or kayaking at low tide to see sea turtles nesting along with other marine life such as rays, octopus & dolphins at play! You can also go sea kayaking through mangrove forests spotting water birds such as egrets & herons swimming next door to crocodiles! You can even go whale watching almost every day during season (December through April) spotting humpback whales off shore which makes their way up from Patagonia for mating season!



There is also 10 miles (16 km) of white sand beach accessible right off your front door where you can lounge around all day swimming in fresh water pools at low tide or go surfing when ocean waves crash onto shore; both Punta Garza Beach (1 km away) & Playa Manzanillo (8 km away) offer these activities very close by - all accessible by walking trail through jungle forest right down your front door! This beachfront property comes with its own private beach access perfect for relaxing in solitude half way between two beautiful beaches along this coast; if you want quick access to tourist towns like Puerto Jimenez head South towards Playa de Matapalo (9kms), but if you want more privacy head North towards Punta Garza (1km). Both offer great options when venturing out for dinner night life when staying here; otherwise relax at home when staying here since everything you need is available onsite such as gourmet kitchen, pool table & hammock seating areas under palapa roofed porches overlooking gorgeous coastal views... it really doesn't get better than this!!
