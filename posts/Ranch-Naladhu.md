          Ranch Naladhu is a spiritual ranch for recovery of the soul and mind. We offer a variety of treatments and therapies. The center provides an ideal place for recovery from addictions, alcoholism, drug abuse, depression and mental illness. It is also a wonderful getaway spot to get in touch with nature and find peace and tranquility in the beauty of the mountain surroundings.

Naladhu is located at an altitude of 5,000 ft., surrounded by mountains, overlooking the Himalayas on one side and facing a wide expanse of green pastures on the other side.
