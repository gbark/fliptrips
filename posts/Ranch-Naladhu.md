Ranch Naladhu is a ecological ranch that aims to re-create the natural ecosystem, providing a sanctuary for wild animals and plants, while at the same time being a place where visitors can experience the richness of nature. The landscape is a unique blend of vegetation, water bodies and a variety of ecosystems.

Ranch Naladhu is a unique eco-resort located in the midst of wildlife sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu. With its 12 acres of lush green forest and almost 400 species of birds, it is like an oasis in the desert.

We offer luxury villa accommodation with all modern amenities such as air conditioning, wireless internet access and satellite TV. Our small eco-friendly resort is surrounded by rainforest vegetation and water bodies that add to its charm.
