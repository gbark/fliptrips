Lodge Ubud is a magical lodge located in the heart of Ubud. It is a stunning accommodation that offers a wonderful range of amenities and services to ensure you have a memorable holiday. With Free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurant and bar, this property is perfect for unwinding and relaxing.

A lovely hotel in the heart of Ubud within walking distance to all amenities, restaurants and shops. Very friendly, helpful staff. The breakfast was excellent with an extensive selection of Western and Indonesian food, including plenty of healthy options. Rooms are large with comfortable beds, lots of wardrobe space and good air conditioning. The pool is small but the view from the pool area is lovely overlooking Ricefields with nice gardens to wander around in. Highly recommended!
