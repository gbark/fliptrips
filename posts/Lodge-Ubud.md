          Lodge Ubud is a pristene lodge set amidst the rice fields of the Ayung Valley, Ubud. A little gem of a place owned and run by a delightful family. Lovely rooms, great food, personal service and beautiful surroundings. We really enjoyed our stay there.

Kremsir Tegal Sari Resort & Spa is the perfect place for relaxation. It is set in a beautiful location within the lush green environment of Kintamani overlooking Mt Batur and Mt Batukaru, Bali’s highest peaks. The resort’s friendly staff are more than willing to help you discover the natural beauty of this area. Rooms are very comfortable with an authentic Balinese touch to it. Pool is fantastic!!

KubuBali Villas is located on the edge of Bali’s famous rice terraces and offers sweeping views of lush paddy fields and the majestic Gunung Agung (the highest mountain in Bali). The resort consists of eight traditional Balinese houses built around a central pool, designed to ensure maximum privacy whilst at the same time offering guests a sense of community living. Staff were really helpful and friendly as well as providing an excellent level of service throughout our stay.. We will definitely be back again!

The Kamajaya Resort & Spa has been designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing; featuring elegantly furnished suites with private pools; perfect for families or those seeking peace and quiet relaxation in romantic surroundings.. The staff were so lovely and so accommodating – we had such a great time there! Would definitely recommend this resort – we will return!
