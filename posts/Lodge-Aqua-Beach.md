          Lodge Aqua Beach is a jawdropping lodge with a private beach, a spa and a pool. It’s located in an area of stunning beaches but this one is definitely special. The rooms are well designed, the views are amazing and the food is delicious. We stayed here for five nights and wished we could have stayed longer!

Rates: from $500 per night

Park Hyatt Maldives Hadahaa

This is one of the most luxurious hotels I’ve ever stayed at. It has everything you could ask for (except perhaps more than 5 minutes of wifi) and more. It has an amazing spa, two restaurants, two bars, etc. But not only that – it also has its very own private island with an equally amazing restaurant (Fisheye), bar, lounge chairs etc. We stayed here for four nights (even though we booked only three) and it was worth every cent!

Gili Lankanfushi Hotel & Spa Villas & Residences

Gili Lankanfushi is one of the most beautiful resorts in the world. The hotel consists of 8 villas which are built on stilts over the sea so you can enjoy your breakfast while you watch fish swim right under your window or just walk on the pier to dive into the sea on your own private beach!! The resort also has a spa on its own private island with treatment rooms on stilts over the water!! We had dinner there once which was delicious but I wish we could have spent more time on this little island although there were no kids allowed there. But I believe Gili Lankanfushi is even better if you have kids as they will love all this space over the sea with different pools, sandy beaches etc… Read my full review here!
