          Suites Singapore is a historical suites hotel in Chinatown, Singapore, built in 1907.

The hotel was built in 1907 by the Sarkies brothers who also built Raffles Hotel. The hotel closed in the 1970s when it was acquired by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. It underwent a major renovation in 1978 and reopened in 1980 as The Fairmont Singapore. It closed again for another two-year refurbishment in 2001 by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, starting June 2001, to turn the hotel into a Fairmont Heritage property.

In addition to its historical connections with the Sarkies brothers, it is also well known for its association with several colourful characters including Joseph Conrad who stayed at the hotel while writing his novel "Lord Jim" (Conrad stayed here because no other hotel would take him). The Fairmont Singapore is also where American writer Ernest Hemingway finished his novel "For Whom the Bell Tolls".
