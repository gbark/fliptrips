          Château Shoreditch is a vibrant château in a great location, particularly if you’re going to the Olympic Park. It is an easy walk from Shoreditch High Street and Liverpool Street station. For a château it has a lot of personality, and the rooms are different to what you’d expect from a traditional château.

The rooms are small but well equipped, with comfy beds and high-quality linen. There’s also a large bathroom with a bathtub. The place was clean and comfortable, and I’ll definitely stay there again should I go back. The staff were very friendly and accommodating too!

Other than the château itself, Shoreditch is full of restaurants and shops so you can get your evening meal there or take advantage of the bars in the area. There is also an overground station so it is easy to get around if you don’t fancy walking everywhere!
