Camp San Ignacio is a pristene campground located in the Petrified Forest National Park. The campground is far from the crowds and roads and is situated among an old growth cottonwood forest. It's a lovely place to spend a night while enjoying the views of the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest National Park.

Camp San Ignacio has 85 campsites, some of which are right on the river. The campground has two family camping loops, each with 24 sites that can accommodate up to six people each. A new loop opened in 2015 with additional sites, including wheelchair accessible sites. Each campsite is near a picnic table and grill, but no other amenities exist at this remote campground.

Camping at Camp San Ignacio requires a backcountry permit from the ranger station near the entrance to the park. Permits are limited so reserve well in advance if you want to stay overnight, or pick up one of 10 permits given out daily at the park entrance station.
