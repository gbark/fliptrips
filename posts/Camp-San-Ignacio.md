          Camp San Ignacio is a jawdropping campground with a perfect waterfront view. As you set up camp, you'll be able to see the castle-like islands across the water (one of them is actually occupied; the other is not). Campsites are available on both sides of the river; however, there are no trees, so it can get very hot during the day.

Camping San Ignacio is an experience like no other! The campsites are located right on the beach (and river), making for an amazing view; however, there are no trees to provide shade or shelter from the elements. The beach here was definitely one of my favorites in all of Panama. It's a long stretch of white sand and clear water that's great for swimming and relaxing. I highly recommend visiting Playa San Ignacio and staying at Camping San Ignacio if you want a truly unique camping experience!

Things to Do in Bocas del Toro: Tours & Activities

Want to know what to do in Bocas del Toro? There's no shortage of things to do here! While I was here, I did several tours and activities including:

Bocas Breeze â€“ A Fun Way To See The Islands Of Bocas Del Toro!

The Bocas Breeze is a super fun way to see some of the more popular islands in one day! For $50 USD per person (including drinks), you'll be picked up by bus at your campsite or hotel and taken across town for pickup by catamaran. You'll sail around the main island of Isla Colon and head out into some smaller surrounding islands as well as visit an off-the-beaten-path island known as Mangua Cays. This tour takes all day, but includes lunch on board as well as lots of rum punch. It was definitely my favorite tour I did while in Panama!
