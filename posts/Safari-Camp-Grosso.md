Safari Camp Grosso is a rustic safari camp consisting of 12 tents and 2 suites. The camp overlooks a waterhole and the camp has its own private airstrip. Game drives and bushwalks can be arranged with lodge staff.

Safari Camp Grosso is highly recommended as a good experience for those who want to move away from the more common "high end" safari camps, but don't want to compromise on the quality of service offered.
