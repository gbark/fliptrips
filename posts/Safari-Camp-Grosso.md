          Safari Camp Grosso is a pristene safari camp that offers the best of Tanzania safaris at its most picturesque location. The camp is set in a private concession bordering the popular Selous Reserve, where the famous elephant corridor traverses between the greater Rukwa ecosystem and the Selous Game Reserve. Safari Camp Grosso is an intimate camp with only four tents, all of which are spacious with ensuite.

Safari Camp Grosso is set on a hilltop overlooking a dried up river, with sweeping views over the surrounding plains where Masai giraffe, hippo, Cape buffalo and other wildlife roam freely. From here one can enjoy very close-up views of this beautiful area and spend time watching wildlife while having sundowners in the early evening sun.
