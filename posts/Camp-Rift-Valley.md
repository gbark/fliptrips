Camp Rift Valley is a breathtaking camp, nestled in the heart of the Great Rift Valley. It is set on a raised balcony, overlooking a sweeping panorama of wildlife and savannah.

The camp offers spacious and comfortable en-suite tents with king-size beds, an en-suite bathroom and a separate dressing room. The Tented Camp is exclusively for adults only (minimum 18 years old).

All the tents are equipped with iPod docking stations, air conditioning and ceiling fans. Each has its own private viewing deck with spectacular views of the Maasai Mara. The tents are fully serviced every day and evening tea is served in the main lounge area at 5:30 pm each evening. A full range of drinks and snacks is available 24 hours a day from our pantry.
