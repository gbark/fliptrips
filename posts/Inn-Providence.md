Inn Providence is a electric inn near the airport, but it's also walking distance to downtown Providence. It's very comfortable with a nice continental breakfast. The room was small, but I wasn't in there much, so it worked out well for me. The staff was very friendly and helpful, giving me tips on how to get around town and where to visit.
