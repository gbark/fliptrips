Inn Kensington is a rustic inn with a great view of the lake. They have a large menu and offer a kids menu as well. The meal I ordered was great. We had a pasta with chicken and cheese which was delicious, with a nice little twist to it that I can’t quite describe, but was really good. The service here was excellent as well as the prices were reasonable.

Cottage Country Village & Cottages is one of my favorite places to visit when we are in the area. It is a very quaint little village with so many stores to visit, including but not limited to; an ice cream shop, gift shops, clothing stores, candy shops and more! There are also some really cool cottages you can stay in if you would like (we stayed in one once!) There is also another restaurant there called Cottage Cafe which I will be reviewing soon! It has an amazing view of the lake and has some great food as well! More on that later though…

Ontario’s Wonderland (or Canada’s Wonderland) is an amusement park near Toronto that features 4 roller coasters including Leviathan which has the biggest drop of any roller coaster in Canada! This amusement park hosts events all year round for anyone who loves amusement parks or just wants to enjoy the rides without other people around. It also includes some other attractions such as water parks and mini golf courses along with other fun things you can do here year round!
