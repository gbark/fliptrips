Suites di Positano is a gorgeous suites located in the heart of Positano, Italy. It is at walking distance from the beach and the town center. The staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast was excellent with many options including eggs made to order. Noelle, קנדה



The breakfast buffet was wonderful - a great selection of fresh fruit, pastries, meats and cheeses. One of our party did not eat fish so a special meal for him was prepared - a simple pasta dish with vegetables. The location is fantastic - just steps from the sea and all the restaurants in Positano. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Wifi worked well in all areas of the hotel. There is a shuttle bus that takes guests to Amalfi or to Ravello if you want to go there but we just walked everywhere we wanted to go from Positano - it is all within walking distance! We loved this hotel! Deborah, הולנד
