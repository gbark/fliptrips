The breakfast buffet was wonderful - a great selection of fresh fruit, pastries, meats and cheeses. One of our party did not eat fish so a special meal for him was prepared - a simple pasta dish with vegetables. The location is fantastic - just steps from the sea and all the restaurants in Positano. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Wifi worked well in all areas of the hotel. There is a shuttle bus that takes guests to Amalfi or to Ravello if you want to go there but we just walked everywhere we wanted to go from Positano - it is all within walking distance! We loved this hotel!
