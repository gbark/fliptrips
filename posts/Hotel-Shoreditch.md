Hotel Shoreditch is a sophisticated hotel, located in the heart of East London, a stones throw from Shoreditch High Street and a few minutes walk from Old Street Tube Station. The hotel is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World and has just undergone a major renovation. The rooms have been completely refurbished and are modern, chic and cool with great views of either Shoreditch High Street or the City.

The hotel is part of the Merchant Square development which was established in 2005 as an architectural statement to be proud of. The development consists of four buildings, one of which hosts Hotel Shoreditch, two residential properties and a suite of shops.

The hotel has a stunning lobby with a library-style main reception where you’ll be welcomed with hot drinks by concierge staff. If you’re checking in before 12pm then you can take advantage of their complimentary breakfast to get your day off to an energised start.

A selection of complimentary newspapers are available for guests on arrival, as well as local magazines showcasing the East End’s best attractions. You can sit back with your newspaper or book yourself into one of several nearby restaurants for dinner that evening – there’s plenty to choose from!
