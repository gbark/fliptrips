          Hotel Shoreditch is a historical hotel in a great location. We stayed in a single room with a private bathroom, which was very clean and well-kept. The hotel also has an elevator, which is a nice perk if you have any mobility issues or are traveling with someone who does.The staff were very accommodating and answered all our questions with ease. The hotel's restaurant, Bocca di Lupo, is also highly recommended - we had one of the best meals of our trip there!
