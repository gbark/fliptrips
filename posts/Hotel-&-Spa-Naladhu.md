          Hotel & Spa Naladhu is a upscale hotel & spa located in the famous heritage city of Mysore. The rooms are well equipped with all modern amenities such as Air-conditioning, Cable TV (with local channels), Hair dryer and Attached Bathroom with hot/cold running water.

There is a restaurant, health club and bar at the hotel, however the rooms do not have a view of either the valley or palace. The hotel is located very near to the main road and hence getting cabs and autos is easy.

Hotel & Spa Naladhu offers excellent accommodation and restaurant facilities at a very reasonable price.
