Hotel & Spa Naladhu is a sun-soaked hotel & spa on the beach, perfect for a beachside getaway. Our Naladhu tradition of hospitality is as warm as the Maldivian sun. Join us for a relaxing stay in our spectacularly appointed sea view guest rooms and suites, enjoy our fresh seafood from our beachfront restaurant or relax with a spa treatment or massage at Naladhu Spa.

Naladhu offers a wide range of activities to enjoy the stunning views and beauty of our island paradise. We invite you to explore the local traditions and crafts of Maldives by joining one of our excursions, take a refreshing dip in one of the many water sports activities or simply spend your day relaxing on the private beach with your favourite drink from the bar.

We look forward to welcoming you to Hotel & Spa Naladhu- The Island Sojourn.
