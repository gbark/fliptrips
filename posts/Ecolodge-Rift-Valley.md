Ecolodge Rift Valley is a charming ecolodge with a warm welcome, set in a lush garden with African wildlife.

We're located in the heart of the Rift Valley, an hour outside Nairobi.



Our tour desk can arrange for you to have a guide take you on a tour of the local Maasai villages or visit the nearby Iten hills for some running or hiking.
