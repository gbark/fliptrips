		<title>Camp Yasuni National Park</title>
		<link href="https://update-me.com/posts/Camp-Yasuni-National-Park/"/>
		<updated>2021-10-20T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://update-me.com/posts/Camp-Yasuni-National-Park/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Camp Yasuni National Park is a magical camp, located in a private concession outside the National Park. It&#39;s a small, rustic camp with a series of open-air bamboo huts, built on stilts. There are no walls to separate you from the wildlife or from your neighbors. The staff at the campsite is very attentive and knowledgeable. The food is excellent, but the best part of this camp is its location. It&#39;s remote enough to feel as if you&#39;re completely immersed in the rainforest, yet easy enough to get to that you can take day trips into Yasuni National Park or take a boat ride across the river and see some of the local villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camp Yasuni&#39;s property is located right on a small tributary of the San Miguel River, about 20 minutes from Puyo and 15 minutes from Shushufindi Airport (the only airport in Yasuni). The road leading up to it is rough but passable with a 4x4 vehicle (though we saw many cars and trucks all along the road). The location is good for exploring both sides of Yasuni National Park — we stayed at Camp Yasuni one night and then spent four nights at Camp Tinquilica before heading back to Quito — and provides access to several short trails that lead down to local rivers and lakes or up into the rainforest canopy for bird-watching and wildlife viewing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuní Rainforest Lodge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuní Rainforest Lodge is located inside Yasuní National Park, near its northern boundary (the southern boundary ends about 35 minutes away). This lodge has very limited facilities (no electricity or hot water) but has an amazing location within one of Ecuador’s most biodiverse areas — it borders Parque Nacional Cuyabeno — and thus provides opportunities for fantastic wildlife viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuní Rainforest Lodge was our first stop after arriving in Ecuador; we spent two nights there before moving on to Tambopata Research Center (TRC), which was our primary base for visiting the Manu Biosphere Reserve in Peru during our visit there last year. I highly recommend spending two nights here before visiting TRC; this will give you time to adjust to life in Ecuador before visiting tropical lowlands that are far more humid than where you&#39;ve been staying previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most lodges in Ecuador, Yasuní Rainforest Lodge has few amenities beyond what it takes for its guests not to suffer from extreme discomfort. However, even if you’re not accustomed to roughing it or living without electricity or television or hot water, this place will be easy for you because its reputation precedes it: Because it has exceptionally great bird-watching opportunities right outside your door! It also provides easy access into nearby Cuyabeno National Park via an old single-track dirt road that leads out through Manzanillo village just across the river from us here in Metropolitana Norte province in Ecuador&#39;s Oriente region, so it&#39;s also great for viewing monkeys, alligators/crocodiles/caimans/iguanas, sloths, tapirs, peccaries/wild pigs/warthogs/peccaries/wild pigs/warthogs/wild boars (depending on who&#39;s doing what), capybaras (world&#39;s largest rodents), caimans (giant alligators), river otters (world&#39;s smallest otters), piranhas … well … OK … I guess I&#39;m getting carried away here; there are too many animals here! But seriously though: This place has excellent wildlife watching opportunities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above though: You&#39;ll be roughing it here! You&#39;ll need insect repellent during our rainy season! The lodge itself sits on stilts above a series of ponds; each unit consists of two rooms connected by a screened entrance porch that contains mosquito nets over each bed while allowing unobstructed views of nearby vegetation while sitting inside. There are separate bathrooms that have cold-water showers at ground level behind each unit; they&#39;re screened off so bugs can&#39;t get into them while you&#39;re conducting your barefoot ablutions under cold running water … but they don&#39;t have any doors so bugs can walk right up onto your toilet seat! As I&#39;ve mentioned before though: Insects aren’t really an issue here because this area doesn&#39;t have malaria-carrying mosquitoes like some places do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lodge itself sits atop some high ground overlooking several quiet ponds full of fish; these ponds also provide habitat for crocodiles and giant river otters as well as numerous species of birds such as herons &amp;amp; egrets &amp;amp; ducks &amp;amp; kingfishers &amp;amp; cormorants &amp;amp; ospreys &amp;amp; parrots … seriously though: If there were ever a place where you could go bird watching without having any kind of special equipment other than your own eyesight (&amp;amp; maybe binoculars) then this place would be it! In fact: If there were ever a place where someone could become ambidextrous between binoculars &amp;amp; cameras then this would definitely be that place too because there are birds everywhere!! But seriously though: This place really does have exceptional birdwatching opportunities! And when you say &amp;quot;bird watching&amp;quot; all I can think about is seeing loads upon loads upon loads upon loads upon loads upon loads upon loads upon loads upon stacks upon stacks upon stacks upon stacks upon stacks upon stacks oh my gosh so much birds!!

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Hotel Singapore is a gastronomical hotel concept. A hotel designed to be enjoyed through the senses with distinctive dining experiences, state-of-the-art meeting facilities, and an atmosphere that is at once provocative and memorable. Hotel Singapore is a home away from home for even the most discerning travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Singapore’s colonial past left it with an impressive number of grand hotels, the island’s future lies in the creation of a vibrant cosmopolitan city that is accessible and affordable for all guests. The architectural concept of Hotel Singapore’s design aims to create a landmark hotel that blends seamlessly into its urban environment while projecting a sense of lightness and modernity that reflects the forward thinking capital’s cosmopolitan spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Guest House Virgin Gorda</title>

		<id>https://update-me.com/posts/Guest-House-Virgin-Gorda/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Guest House Virgin Gorda is a sun-soaked guest house that is an easy walk from the airport. The breakfast is outstanding with a wide selection of items, all made fresh daily. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this stop if you are traveling through the BVI&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful B&amp;amp;B 4,6 sur mai 12, 2014 Beautiful setting, wonderful breakfast with great variety, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful vacation 5 sur avril 23, 2014 Virgin Gorda is one of our favorite places on earth and we have stayed at most of the hotels there over the years. Sunset House was one of the best! The location allowed us to explore all over the island by bike or car (no need for a car if you stay here). The staff were super helpful and super nice; they know everything about everything on Virgin Gorda (from restaurants to scuba diving). They were always there to help no matter what time of day it was (and they make amazing breakfasts!). When we return to Virgin Gorda we will definitely stay here again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great place to stay in Virgin Gorda 4,2 sur avril 11, 2014 We stayed one night at Sunset House in March 2014 and had a great experience. Our room had an excellent view of Gun Creek -- if you like bird watching or just want some peace and quiet this is definitely where you want to be! It&#39;s also only about 5 minutes walk down to Little Dix Bay so it has easy access to restaurants and bars but still feels private away from everything else. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Camp San Ignacio</title>
		<link href="https://update-me.com/posts/Camp-San-Ignacio/"/>
		<updated>2021-11-18T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://update-me.com/posts/Camp-San-Ignacio/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Camp San Ignacio is a pristene campground located in the Petrified Forest National Park. The campground is far from the crowds and roads and is situated among an old growth cottonwood forest. It&#39;s a lovely place to spend a night while enjoying the views of the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camp San Ignacio has 85 campsites, some of which are right on the river. The campground has two family camping loops, each with 24 sites that can accommodate up to six people each. A new loop opened in 2015 with additional sites, including wheelchair accessible sites. Each campsite is near a picnic table and grill, but no other amenities exist at this remote campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping at Camp San Ignacio requires a backcountry permit from the ranger station near the entrance to the park. Permits are limited so reserve well in advance if you want to stay overnight, or pick up one of 10 permits given out daily at the park entrance station.&lt;/p&gt;
