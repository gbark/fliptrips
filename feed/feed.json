One of our party did not eat fish so a special meal for him was prepared - a simple pasta dish with vegetables. The location is fantastic - just steps from the sea and all the restaurants in Positano. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Wifi worked well in all areas of the hotel.

You can rent the rooms with or without breakfast.</p>\n<p>En Route: Positano to Amalfi</p>\n<p>From Positano, head along the coast road towards Amalfi. Along the way, you will pass through villages like Praiano, Vietri sul Mare and Minori. You will also see several beautiful beaches like Conca dei Marini and Castellammare di Stabia.</p>\n<p>At the end of this stretch is Amalfi, an ancient town perched on a cliff at the foot of Monte Cerreto. On one side is the sea, on the other side is an impressive mountain range known as Maiella (or Majella). The city is famous for its port and terraced lemon groves. It’s also known for its lace making tradition which dates back to Byzantine days. Some of its souvenirs are said to be made by women who are over 100 years old!</p>\n<p>One attraction that you should not miss at Amalfi is Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta (Cathedral of Saint Mary Assumed into Heaven). It’s a Romanesque church built in 1073 AD and it has been rebuilt several times over the centuries. Its Gothic bell tower stands tall at 61 meters high and from there you have a panoramic view of the hillsides below. Inside, you will find a beautiful baptismal font which dates back to 1240 AD as well as a statue of Saint Andrew by Gagini, a 13th-century sculptor from Pisa who created it in 1260 AD for Palazzo del Podestà in Pisa before being relocated here in 1358 AD after being moved from its original location inside Palazzo del Podestà in Pisa due to Napoleon’s invasion during which it was damaged during World War II bombings in 1944 AD. This statue was moved to Vico Equense from Palazzo del Podestà where it was damaged again during World War II bombings before being moved once more to Amalfi for safekeeping where it replaced an earlier statue destroyed during World War II bombings which itself replaced a 14th-century wooden statue which was burned down by arsonists in 1836 AD before being replaced by another bronze statue destroyed by Arsonists again around 1880 AD before being replaced yet again with yet another one created by another artist named Cipriano Facchino who worked on this project between 1906 – 1913 after creating other statues such as that of Saint Michael Archangel located behind Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta together with that of Saint Anthony Abbot located beside Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta and those found inside both churches San Pietro Martire and San Bartolomeo Abate respectively), both designed to protect against earthquakes and fires – including those caused by arsonists – which could threaten life and property within their communities at risk or face destruction due to such calamities or malicious acts committed against them such as those already mentioned previously which had already happened here as well as those committed against them elsewhere like those at Basilica della Santissima Annunziata located within Santa Maria Novella Church complex within Florence or those that had already happened elsewhere around Italy such as those that had already taken place outside Rome including those at Basilica della Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini located at Porta Maggiore near Rome (which was built between 1732 – 1739 AD) or Montevergine Abbey (built between 1072 – 1089 AD) located near Benevento (both designed by architect Francesco Azzurri) while having survived some major disasters including numerous earthquakes like that one that struck on 26 December 26 December 1980 soon after Christmas Day had passed while some were struck on 9 August 1349 when another struck

Many locals advise against carrying valuables in a bag after dark as one common scam involves bicycle thieves: A thief will ride by you and snatch your bag which is rigged with an alarm device (even though it wouldn't be heard if you were wearing earplugs). When it snatches your bag it will quickly switch off so that you cannot even hear it anymore, making people think that nothing happened. It is also advised that you do not carry your bags on your front side when walking down a dark street at night past bar-filled alleyways where thieves could easily snatch them from your hands without noticing you in advance. Besides bicycle theft there are other more sophisticated scams such as counterfeiting currencies from ATM machines using a &quot;skimmer&quot; device installed in some ATMs which are able to read bank cards' magnetic strips remotely which allows criminals to make copies of them allowing them to withdraw money from any ATM machine they wish without needing your PIN number or even having physical possession of your card during what seems like an ordinary transaction while you are unaware until days later when you get an unexpected call from local police who tell you that there are charges made on your bank account which you had no idea were made due to somebody tampering with ATM machines using these skimmers or placing skimmer devices inside ATMs where they record the information stored on the magnetic strip on your bank card including pin number while taking advantage of some technical flaw in their programming so they appear authentic when being used while later copying said data onto new blank cards allowing these scammers who use these &quot;skimmers&quot; or hackers who place them inside empty ATMs after hours so they can collect said data undetected before placing their bogus cards back inside afterwards so they can record pin numbers again while unsuspecting customers would insert their own cards into these infected ATMs not knowing what had just happened until days later when police contact them about fraudulent purchases made on their bank account which was compromised due to skimmers being placed inside various ATMs around town by organized crime gangs who know how exactly how these programs work knowing exactly how many characters must be entered for this type of transaction in order for stolen money withdrawn from another person's account through this type of transaction would be deposited into yours instead probably through some kind of error notification appearing during some kind of security update forced upon customers recently released by your bank where transactions involving more than 3 digits must be entered resulting in these scammers recording 4 digit numbers instead specifically designed for making people think that nothing happened when they enter only 3 digits thus avoiding raising suspicion when withdrawing larger amounts of money when entering fewer digits than required especially since most people using ATM machines usually only enter 2 digits when withdrawing amounts less than 100 baht thinking nothing about it since most people assume if nobody uses more than 2 digits then why should anyone use 4? Due to this most people do not notice anything wrong until days later after finding out via phone calls by phone companies informing them about large sums being withdrawn under their name with no pin number involved especially after leaving town for weeks or even months unaware that someone else has been withdrawing cash under their name using fake cards created using stolen personal information taken either directly from corrupt employees working for these phone companies who have direct access via computer systems containing personal information about customers especially cell phone account holders possibly due to weak security measures taken thus allowing access into sensitive areas without having proper security clearance leading employees into accessing databases containing personal information regarding other customers possibly due to lackadaisical attitudes regarding responsibility towards job requiring direct access into sensitive information possibly because those responsible were hired because those responsible were friends with those responsible for hiring those responsible thus nobody was doing their jobs properly thus leading hackers taking advantage by stealing names either online or offline then hacking computer systems containing sensitive data belonging not only themselves but other people as well so this problem has been going on since computers have been invented because nobody takes any real precautions against hackers stealing personal data belonging not only themselves but other people so this problem could have been avoided if databases containing sensitive data belonging not only themselves but other people could have been kept offline instead online where hackers could never get at them unless someone physically hacked into servers containing said databases physically removing hard drives storing said databases removing flash drives storing said databases removing memory sticks storing said databases removing micro SD cards storing said databases removing SIM cards storing said databases removing USB sticks storing said databases locating places within servers containing backup files containing backups containing backups containing

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/plains/pexels-rodnae-productions-7894962.jpg\" alt=\"Camp Naladhu\"></p>\n<p>Camp Naladhu is a remote camp site in the Baliem Valley on the north side of the Baliem Valley, which is about 55 km north of Wamena. The name Naladhu means &quot;Land of the Waterlilies&quot; in local Dani language. As its name implies, Naladhu is a beautiful place surrounded by an abundance of water, where water lilies grow naturally. Naladhu is situated on the bank of the Baliem River with a length of about 3.5 km. The river runs through many rapids and is surrounded by cliffs on both sides. The waters are clear and clean providing good fishing for native people living nearby.</p>\n<p>Naladhu was established as a remote clinic for STF (Student Team Foundation) in 1981 with the help of Australian volunteers, Mr Fred Mogg and Mrs Val Hoddle who were working at STF at that time. Their aim was to provide basic health care services to local people living around Baliem Valley whom were very isolated even from other villages in that valley due to high peaks surrounding it. There were no roads or any other transportation way there at that time, but only footpaths to cross over mountains and valleys which caused difficulties to reach there especially during rainy season when pathways were covered with mud or washed away by torrents carried down by heavy rains which would normally last for 3–4 months per year.</p>\n<p>The first clinic was built using bamboo with earth flooring and grass roofing with total area less than 10 square meters without electricity or running water. Most basic health care services could be provided there such as minor surgery (e.g.: removal teeth), childbirth assistance, vaccinations for children, physiotherapy sessions etc. During 1981-1985 when Mr Mogg and Mrs Hoddle worked there they also provided schools for local children because previous schools in that area had been either destroyed during fighting between Dani tribes or because they had moved out due to fighting during tribal wars between Dani tribes over traditional territories or hunting grounds since 1970s up to 1990s when tribal wars ceased in Papua Province due to government's efforts under special autonomy program in Papua Province implemented since 2001–2004 after East Timor became independent from Indonesia in 1999 . Today there are four schools around Baliem Valley operated by STF (Student Team Foundation).</p>\n<p>When Mr Mogg left STF (Student Team Foundation) in 1985 he gave responsibility for running this clinic to Dr Peter Ward who was one of volunteers working at this clinic until 1991 when he returned back home . Dr Peter Ward also built another small clinic next to his house using concrete flooring and roof made out of metal sheeting replacing earlier structure built by Mr Mogg using bamboo . He also built two separate shelters next his house where patients could stay overnight if needed because it took 2 days walking along mountain paths from this remote clinic up until down stream Wamena town where main road ends . This remote clinic was finally closed down in 1992 after Dr Ward left Papua New Guinea back home after spending almost 20 years working with STF (Student Team Foundation) .</p>\n",

The reserve is surrounded by a 9km electric fence to prevent poachers from entering the area. This makes it much safer to walk around during game drives.

The château is surrounded by a park with ponds and fountains.</p>\n<p>The château was built between 1695 and 1700 as a hunting lodge for Jacques-Armand de Coligny, marquis de Villars (1653–1730) and his wife Louise de Marillac (1660–1733). The building was designed by the architect Pierre Malingre (1664–1735). The Marquis de Villars was at that time governor of the Dauphiné province and captain of the Royal Guards of Louis XIV.</p>\n<p>After donations from its owners, Marylebone passed to John Aubrey, an English antiquary who wrote &quot;Brief Lives&quot; for his friends. Aubrey named it &quot;Mary Le Bone&quot;. He made various improvements to the château including the construction of a chapel which still stands today.</p>\n<p>Marylebone passed soon after to Marie Madeleine d’Hautefort, Viscomtess d’Auvergne, who left it to her nephew Louis-Henri-Maximilien Comte de Beauvilliers. Beauvilliers had been appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1751. He was also known for his work on Frederick II of Prussia's war propaganda in which he supported British policy during the Seven Years' War. In 1773 he sold Marylebone to Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland (1705–74), then British ambassador at St Petersburg, who entertained there many notable guests including Tsarina Elizabeth I of Russia in 1773. After Holland's death Marylebone passed to his son Charles James Fox (1749–1806), statesman and political leader known as &quot;the English Cicero&quot;. It was during this period that Horace Walpole wrote his famous novel &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; based on Marylebone's interior decoration. Charles James Fox sold it in 1793 to Thomas Pitt who lived there before returning it to Lady Holland after he wounded her son at a duel. She then sold it again in 1810 after Fox's death to Sir John Malcolm (1769–1833) Military engineer and diplomatist whose father had retired there after returning from India where he had served as governor of Bombay between 1781 and 1784. Malcolm used it as a country retreat for his family until 1820 when he sold it again after returning from St Petersburg where he had served as ambassador until 1811 under Tsar Lady Holland's son Lord Holland (Charles James Fox's grandson) after whom today's Holland House is named). His daughter Anne Isabella Malcolm (1803-1844) died at Marylebone at age 41 without having married or having children which caused its sale by her brother Lord Abercorn Malcolm who died there in 1844 aged 52 soon after its purchase by William Craven Earl Craven (1800–1870).<br>\nCraven lived there mostly with his wife Louise Elisabeth de Meheux d'Albert de Luynes whom he married 3 years earlier but still paid visits each year with their children from their respective spouses:</p>\n",

They did their very best to make us feel comfortable during our stay at the lodge.</p>\n<p>We stayed in an amazing room which was on the top floor. We had our own personal balcony with a hammock overlooking the river below us. During breakfast we would see monkeys hanging out around us eating bananas from trees just outside our balcony! During our stay at the lodge we saw spider monkeys, toucans, macaws, gorgeous butterflies, and many other animals we never expected to see in Costa Rica! We also witnessed two hippos spouting in between rapids in an area of the river called “the whirlpool” which was incredible! The water there was crystal clear and it is definitely worth taking an afternoon trip there to experience it yourself! You can book this excursion directly through your hotel or through one of their tour companies such as Aventuras Naturales or Turismo De La Selva (both located in La Fortuna).</p>\n<p>We started with one activity each day at 8:30AM and most times we finished by 2:00PM or 3:00PM (depending on how much time we wanted to spend hiking)! This allowed us plenty of time to explore more activities like horseback riding (with our guide Angel), ziplining (at Zipline Canopy Tours), or walking through their butterfly garden/learning about all different types of butterflies that live in tropical rainforests (at Butterfly Garden). All these activities were included in our package also with transportation included from/to San Jose Airport (SJO) which made it really easy for us while traveling alone since sometimes English speaking guides aren’t available along with transportation options being limited due to language barriers when traveling alone while visiting other countries especially when you do not speak fluent Spanish or Portuguese languages fluently like I do not :p</p>\n<p>If you are looking for something more luxurious then Dos Pueblos Hotel located just outside of San Jose may be right up your alley although I have never stayed there so I cannot say anything about the hotel itself other than it looks nice from what I have seen online but I have heard nothing but great things about it so if luxury suites are what you prefer then Dos Pueblos Hotel may be worth considering if staying closer to San Jose area is something that interests you instead of staying closer to La Fortuna area where most hotels listed here are located unless you wish to walk 15-20 minutes into town for dinner/desserts/dancing at night etc… If that doesn’t matter then definitely consider staying closer to La Fortuna area where all these hotels below are located instead because it will give you easy access into town during dinner/desserts/dancing etc… Also many local restaurants are only open 6-9PM which means getting dinner after 6PM means having dinner around 9PM since most people eat earlier than that at restaurants close by…. Most hotels listed here allow guests free access into town during dinner time so no need to worry about eating late if staying here because many local restaurants close up shop early anyways…. Just saying ;) Hope this helps anyone who has booked hotels listed here thinking they don’t serve food until 7PM or 8PM when actually they serve food earlier than that since everything closes up shop early around 10PM anyways… Hope this helped anyone who cares lol… Just trying to help fellow travelers :)</p>\n<p>Hotels around La Fortuna near Arenal Volcano National Park:</p>\n",

It has four tall storeys and a tall attic, and is similar in style to Palazzo Spada.</p>\n<p>The palace was commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V (1605-1621) and patron to Bernini among others, for his own use. Its design was probably based on drawings by Raphael, who was to have been its original owner. It is built around an open colonnaded courtyard which had no garden access until the 19th century. The entrance leads into the hall of the first floor with its famous frescoed ceiling painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1603 depicting angels playing musical instruments. At the far end is the chapel, with its gilded ceiling by Guercino (1619), surmounted by a cupola decorated with frescoes depicting four episodes from the life of Christ. The chapel also contains two marble angels by Bernini (1621-22). The large busts are of Julius Caesar and Alexander Severus, rescued from their earlier site at Palazzo Farnese after it was demolished to make way for St Peter's basilica.</p>\n<p>Palazzo Barberini</p>\n<p>Palazzo Barberini is one of Rome's greatest Baroque palaces built between 1625 and 1633 for Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, nephew of Pope Urban VIII (1623-44).

Access between floors is through an elegantly tiled staircase leading up through a small loggia overlooking the Piazza Barberini which opens onto a second loggia leading into one of two internal courtyards flanked on all sides with high arches supporting more storeys above it punctuated by huge oval windows that flood light into all parts of this vast palatial complex designed as a city within a city within Rome itself.</p>\n",

As I’ve written about before, this hotel is a tranquil oasis peeks out from the lush foliage of Virgin Gorda. It is a little jewel of a resort that has been designed with an eco-friendly touch, as it focuses on sustainable practices and green initiatives.</p>\n<p>The rooms are very comfortable at this resort, as they have been modernized with the necessary features to make your stay as relaxing as possible. The bathroom is well-equipped and spacious and I especially liked the fact that each room has its own private balcony.</p>\n<p>As for dining options, there are two restaurants – one casual and the other fine dining – plus a pool bar and a beach bar. At the pool bar you’ll find fresh fruit shakes and smoothies along with light snacks such as cheese platters and sandwiches. The beach bar serves up tasty cocktails such as Painkillers (dark rum, pineapple juice, peanut butter &amp; coconut milk) along with small bite snacks such as crudites or roasted sweet potatoes topped with jerk seasoning.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend trying out their signature bath menu (the sauna and steam room at this hotel come free!) which includes an array of spa services like massages, facials, body treatments and wraps. You can also enjoy treatments in your own room or suite if you wish! If you’re looking for some romantic alone time together, book one of their couples massage sessions (which can also be done in your room) – they offer Swedish massage (60 mins.) or Acupressure massage (90 mins.). I opted for the acupressure massage which was excellent! My husband opted for an hour long Swedish massage which he said was superb; he actually almost fell asleep at one point!</p>\n",

Guests are able to explore the bush on foot or drive along our extensive network of dirt roads. The lodge offers an exclusive service for small groups which includes a personal guide who will accompany guests on game drives and walks to ensure their every wish is granted.</p>\n<p>The heart of Ecolodge Sabi Sands consists of four uKhahlamba traditional rondavels set amongst lush indigenous forest overlooking a waterhole where elephants regularly come to drink. The four en-suite rondavels have been designed with both comfort and style in mind with ensuite bathrooms, underfloor heating and an open plan design that will ensure you never feel too far away from nature. No two rondavels are identical; each has its own individual character with huge picture windows allowing guests to enjoy uninterrupted views over this magical area.</p>\n<p>There are also three spacious tented suites made from canvas and wood offering an experience not found anywhere else in South Africa today. Each tent has its own private decking area which overlooks the waterhole where game can be easily spotted; no decking area is ever shared with other tents. The style is rustic but comfortable; each tent features a double bed, comfortable lounges and stunning décor throughout including hand-loomed floor coverings made by local women at Stony Plain Farm (a community initiative run by Ecolodge) located just outside Hazyview - approximately 20 minutes by road from Ecolodge Sabi Sands - as well as stunning traditional handmade furniture made locally using indigenous materials such as wickerwork, brickwork and woodcarvings sourced from local villages around Hazyview.</p>\n",

The one-bedroom suite has a king-size bed, a sofa bed in the living room, and a kitchenette. The two-bedroom suite has two bedrooms that share a bathroom (one bedroom has twin beds). Guests receive free access to the nearby Club de Playa Paracas (a beach club with bar, restaurant, pool, and gym), as well as use of beach equipment (such as umbrellas and chairs) at the beach.</p>\n<p>Playa La Arena is 800m (1/2 mile) south of Paracas Bay’s center along Av. Tumbes; look for the large green sign.</p>\n<p>$ Hotel San Martín is on Playa La Arena at Av. Tumbes 715; tel. 084/253-032; <a href=\"http://www.hotelsanmartinperu.com\">www.hotelsanmartinperu.com</a>; $$$$. This hotel has spacious rooms with one king-size bed and a sofa bed in the living room; it also has two suites with king size beds including sofa beds in each room and kitchenettes — all offer balconies or terraces overlooking the sea — air conditioning, cable TV, telephone (with answering machine), Wi-Fi (free), minibar (not always stocked), safe deposit box (not always available), hair dryer, toaster, coffee maker or kettle for tea or hot chocolate — all included in the price! It also has an outdoor pool surrounded by lounge chairs and tables for drinks and snacks while you sunbathe. The restaurant serves breakfast for guests only: it’s not very good but it’s free so why complain? Guests receive free entrance to Club de Playa Paracas — which guests say isn’t worth it — use of beach equipment such as umbrellas and chairs on private beach at El Faro Beach Resort &amp; Spa just across from Hotel San Martín — which is much nicer than La Arena Beach Resort &amp; Spa right across from Hotel San Martín! One reviewer said that “the staff at this hotel was not very helpful especially when we wanted to visit Limón Beach in Paracas Bay area [15 km/9 miles south of Paracas]. We had to walk in sand in order to take pictures of sea lions swimming off shore…There are no facilities near this hotel…The only place where we found something was many kilometers away…The service was poor…[and] there was no hot water when we needed it [during our 5-night stay]. The food was not great but at least there were options [for breakfast]. It was nice [to have] free internet [included], good coffee [and good] Chilean wine [available from their wine list!]…One thing I did like about the hotel were their sunsets over the ocean!!! Overall I would not recommend this hotel because they do not have much to offer.&quot; Another reviewer said: “The place looked really nice online but looks can be deceiving...We stayed 2 nights...[at] $125 per night...[for] 1 bedroom suite...We stayed 2 nights 2 days...[and] spent most our time out side looking for other things to do since there were no other amenities around this place...&quot; One guest wrote: &quot;This guesthouse is located right next door to something called &quot;Hotel La Arena&quot;. That's where I stayed 3 years ago while visiting Paracas National Park - some people may prefer that location since it's more central within walking distance of restaurants etc., but I preferred staying closer to some beaches instead.&quot; One couple wrote: &quot;We weren't happy here at all! Our shower didn't work properly - some days cold water only - sometimes only hot water - sometimes both but weak pressure! We had one towel each when we arrived - even though they knew we were coming! They never cleaned our room while we were there even though they knew we were staying 3 days!&quot; Another guest wrote: &quot;The best thing about this place is its location on beautiful deserted sand dunes just above beautiful deserted beaches.&quot; And another said: &quot;I would rather stay here than at Hotel La Arena across the street just because I prefer sand under my feet than concrete.&quot; So if you want sand under your feet then go here!&quot;</p>\n<p>$$$$+</p>\n<p>Club de Playa Paracas</p>\n<p>Club de Playa Paracas</p>\n<p>$$$$+</p>\n<p>Private Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p>\n<p>$$$$+</p>\n<p>La Arena Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p>\n<p>$$$$+</p>\n<p>El Faro Beach Resort &amp; Spa</p>\n<p>$$$ Hotel Casa Blanca Inn is on Avenida Tumbes 646 between calles Edificio A y Edificio B in front of Club de Playa Paracas; tel./fax 084/253-039 or 084/253-039; <a href=\"http://www.hotelcasablancaperu.com\">www.hotelcasablancaperu.com</a>; $$ . It offers three types of accommodations: Standard Room ($$) with 1 queen bed plus 1 single bed plus 1 bathroom plus kitchenette with mini fridge plus microwave plus TV plus Wi-Fi ($); Patio Room ($$) has 2 queen beds plus 1 single bed plus ceiling fan plus bathroom with tub plus kitchenette with mini fridge plus microwave plus TV plus Wi-Fi ($); Suite ($$$) includes 2 queen size beds or 1 king size bed + 1 single + ceiling fan + bathroom + kitchenette + TV + Wi-Fi ($). All rooms have laundry service available if you ask for it! Guests receive 10% discount off everything except spa services at nearby Aqua Salon Salon &amp; Spa located next door -- which guests say is very expensive anyway -- so don't bother going there! Guests get 50% off meals ordered from 6 pm–9 pm daily at Diego's Restaurant next door -- which guests say isn't worth going anyway -- so don't bother going there either!&quot; Dining options include Diego's Restaurant -- known as one of Peru's best seafood restaurants -- which offers fresh seafood caught daily including oysters from local oyster farms as well as fruits such as mangoes grown locally on their own farm outside town. For those who don't like seafood they offer meat dishes such as pork sausage stewed in beer served over fried potatoes that one guest called &quot;very tasty&quot; and desserts such as flan made fresh every day that one reviewer said was &quot;really good&quot; but another said wasn't very good because she thought it was too sweet.&quot; They also have a full bar including premium imported beers such as Stella Artois (&quot;good&quot;) served ice cold (&quot;really cold!&quot;) by friendly bartenders (&quot;better than friendly!&quot;) who love talking about beer (&quot;okay&quot;). Overall guests recommend eating here because food costs less than eating anywhere else; others don't recommend eating anything else except breakfast buffet offered morning until 11 am daily for $8 per person because it wasn’t worth paying more elsewhere even though reviewers complain that “the breakfast foods aren’t replenished often enough – waited half hour before seeing any foods replenished – long waits – food wasn’t worth waiting for – got sick after eating – probably due to all those flies flying around – saw waiter swatting flies away from trays holding food – yuk…. Also complained about insects flying around dining area – careful what you eat….One annoying thing about this resort is people trying push products on you regardless if you need them or not.&quot; Another reviewer wrote: &quot;I'm scared inside this hostal!!! Not really scary inside but outside!! There are many dogs around here!! Bad dogs!!! The first night I couldn't sleep due those dogs barking....Very dangerous....They know where your car park your car....Most dangerous dog got into my car.....I could see him through my window.....I felt very scared.....He tried bite my car window....Those dogs bite!!!! After he bit my car window he left..... But still feel scared...... Also many insects inside hostal....Bed bugs inside sheets....Not rest well......Noisy outside cause by dogs barking.....Couldn't sleep.....I'll never come back again!!!&quot; Some reviewers complained about having problems getting reservations between Christmas Day thru New Year's Day even though they made reservations months ahead before coming down.&quot; Overall reviewers say rooms are clean except rooms facing street side where cars drive up onto sidewalk disturbing peace by making lots of noise 24 hours a day 7 days a week including horn blowing?!?!? Pools are heated year round 24 hours per day making them perfect for swimming anytime regardless how cold it gets outside --- some called them excellent pools! Small pool area can be crowded some times especially during high season when everyone seems to hang out waiting out stormy weather leaving few lounge chairs available during stormy weather.... Still some reviewers thought pools weren't heated enough --- yet others recommended them calling them perfect temperature ---</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/city/pexels-aleksandar-pasaric-3048538.jpg\" alt=\"Château Castille\"></p>\n<p>Château Castille is a rustic château, originally built in the 17th century, with a later extension. It was the home of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the powerful minister of King Louis XIV.</p>\n<p>The château was built in 1637 for Antoine de Montchapet, a lord of Blérancourt. His son, Pierre-Paul de Montchapet, inherited it in 1649 and changed his name to Montchapet de Castille. He was a supporter of King Louis XIII and served as his treasurer for thirteen years before retiring to Blérancourt at the end of his career. His son Jean-Baptiste de Castille took up residence at Blérancourt after his father's death; he had served as &quot;prévôt des marchands&quot; (roughly equivalent to mayor) of Paris under Louis XIV before retiring to Blérancourt. The king gave him permission to change his name to de Castille d'Espira; this was an attempt by Louis XIV to ensure that all members of the family used the same surname (de Castille d'Espira).</p>\n<p>Castille d'Espira commissioned architect Nicolas Ledoux to build an estate house at Blérancourt around 1695; construction was complete by 1696. Some sources claim that Ledoux based it on designs by François Mansart or Charles Le Brun, but this is unlikely given that Ledoux worked primarily in Paris during this period and only rarely traveled outside the city. It is more probable that he borrowed elements from these designs because he knew them well through copies prepared for Mansart's books on architecture or because they were part of Ledoux's personal collection. He may also have studied engravings made after plans for these mansions during his trip to Italy in 1680–1682, although there are no records showing that he traveled outside northern Italy during this trip. Another source claims that Ledoux drew inspiration from Château Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, although there are no similarities between Château Sainte-Marie-Madeleine and Castille d'Espira other than both being constructed in brick with stone quoins and rusticated stone lintels above windows and doors.</p>\n<p>Castille d'Espira died in 1708 without an heir; his property was sold off over several years beginning in 1712 despite attempts by relatives to keep it out of the hands of strangers or merchants who would likely demolish it once they obtained possession so they could collect taxes on it even though no taxes had been paid since 1698 when Eûgène de Pérusse bought it from its owner at the time Pierre Amelot de Chailloue who received it for services rendered . The estate passed into Pérusse's ownership until 1721 when Jean Bonnefon bought it through intermediaries before selling it just one year later to Pierre Crozat who owned numerous properties throughout France including Château de Gaillon and Château de Fontainebleau which served as royal residences until 1730 when King Louis XV purchased them both from him along with numerous other properties he owned including Château Castille which became part of Louis XV and his wife Marie Leszczyńska's hunting trips while staying at Fontainebleau which became their principal residence while she acted as regent on behalf her young son King Louis XV after her husband died on September 14, 1723 during an epidemic which swept through France ending with her own death on October 7, 1725 . She was buried next to her husband beneath a simple tombstone instead of one covered with gilded sculptures like other members of French royalty . Their children were placed into care while their uncle Philippe II Auguste acted as regent until they reached adulthood .</p>\n<p>Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska had four children: Philip (born January 29, 1725) who became king; Marie Adélaïde (born July 19, 1727); Louise Élisabeth (born July 10, 1728); and Henriette Anne (born May 5, 1732). On November 15, 1737 Marie Adélaïde married Victor Amadeus II Emmanuel , Duke of Savoy , a member of a cadet branch line whose family ruled over Sardinia . As part of their marriage agreement Victor Amadeus received several properties including Château Castile . It then became known as &quot;Château des Dames&quot; or &quot;Dames Castle&quot;. Marie Adélaïde would give birth here two daughters: Princess Victoire Thérèse Félicité born June 18 [O.S.] / July 1 [N.S.] ,1738 ; Princess Sophie Thérèse born July 14 / 23 [O.S.] ,1739 , six days after her father died leaving no male heirs meaning she would become Queen consort upon her mother's ascension since women could not ascend the throne at this time . After Queen Marie Adelaïde 's death April 28 / May 9 [O 11] ,1776 ; Her daughter Queen Sophie Thérèse moved back from Versailles back to Dames Castle where she died December 10 / 20 [O 11] ,1799 aged 58 without any surviving heirs .</p>\n<p>On April 25/ May 6 [O 11] ,1802 Eustache Lambert Edouard Lefebure bought Chateau des Dames From Marie Adelaïde 's widow Louise Joséphine Philippine Duchesse de Berry who also owned other properties around Paris including Hôtel Lambert built By Nicolas Ledoux around 1700 who left no heirs so Lefebure would be named adjutant general du district et président du conseil général des Vosges en 1814..

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/city/pexels-lucas-pezeta-2352348.jpg\" alt=\"Château Shoreditch\"></p>\n<p>Château Shoreditch is a rustic château in Shoreditch, London. It was built in the 19th century and served as a French château in the English countryside. However, it was later abandoned by its owners and used to store garbage. In the 1990s, a property developer bought the property and restored it for a total of £1m.</p>\n<p>Château Shoreditch is a replica of the Château de Groussay, in France. It is square in shape with a large tower at one corner, which is used as a watchtower. Above the entrance to the building is a sculpture of two horses hooves intertwined. Above this are three shields bearing French royal symbols: &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot; and two lions holding &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot;. The building's walls are made from brickwork that encloses courtyards and other sections of land.</p>\n<p>The building stood on land that was originally part of Shoreditch House Estate until it was sold by Edward Solly in 1841 to Charles Fussell Palmer who commissioned architect Thomas Allom to design and build Château Shoreditch in 1866 at an estimated cost of £50,000 (). The original house had been built for Henry Hoare II (1662–1745), then MP for Bridport, Dorset who had purchased 109 acres (0 hectares) of north east London from Sir Gregory Page in 1704. Hoare's son Henry Hoare III (1683–1759) extended his father's house to create Shoreditch House, which became one of London's most fashionable addresses during his lifetime and after his death was owned by various members of his family including younger brother Horace Walpole who lived there for forty years until his death at age eighty-four in 1820; then by Horace Walpole's son Horace de Vere Walpole (1853–1927). The estate passed out of family ownership following Horace de Vere Walpole's death without heirs; over 1,200 lots were sold at auction by Messrs Puttick &amp; Simpson on 27 June 1928 pursuant to the terms set out in his will; Charles Fussell Palmer bought lot 42 which included all but three acres () of Shoreditch House estate including the site where Château Shoreditch was built later that year for £40,000 (). Charles Fussell Palmer died one year later aged fifty-seven without heirs so Château Shoreditch became the property of his widow Lady Alethea Palmer who lived there until her own death at age seventy-six on 8 February 1940 when her only surviving nephew Captain Maurice Henry Fussell Palmer inherited it through her will leaving him with £247 16s 6d () in probate duty (). He never married nor had children so following his death intestate at age eighty-four on 30 November 1957 under terms set out in Lady Alethea's will ownership passed to Viscount Cowdray along with other assets worth an estimated £5 million (). He left no heir when he died intestate four years later leaving Château Shoreditch worth around £1 million (). His wife Lady Katherine Cowdray made several unsuccessful attempts between 1962 and 1978 to sell off various assets including Château Shoreditch before she sold it off separately through Savills estate agents on 9 August 1980 for £1 million () to Peter Carwardine who lived there with his wife Sue until they divorced leaving him with just three acres () around Château Shoreditch which he called &quot;The Island&quot;; he leased part back to his ex-wife Sue allowing her continued access through what had become known as &quot;Sue's Tunnel&quot;.</p>\n<p>The neglected building fell into disrepair over several decades becoming known locally as &quot;Palmerston Tower&quot;, or more affectionately &quot;Shitty Castle&quot;, due mostly to its state having been left derelict for many years while also because some residents believed its presence blocked planning permission for development elsewhere within their neighbourhood; while some reports suggest that this nickname could simply be attributed instead simply because locals thought that Peter Carwardine named it himself after former British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston (1784–1865). However despite local opposition including vandalism during demolition attempts led by local residents' action groups like Friends of Pond Park (formed 1995) &amp; Save Pond Park &amp; Gardens (formed 1999), Carwardine failed on numerous occasions during 1988–2000 to get Westminster Council planning permission for redevelopment proposals which included converting Château Shoreditch into luxury flats featuring health spa facilities while also installing roof gardens onto flats within four surrounding Victorian era tenement buildings (), all directly overlooking Upper Clapton Pond itself - yet he still continued trying right up until shortly before his sudden death from heart failure at age sixty-eight on 25 October 2000 not long after returning from holidaying abroad - despite local residents claiming otherwise publicly claiming instead well before this time that they fully supported keeping this historic structure mostly intact rather than having it demolished &amp; replaced with modern blocks typical among many other buildings found throughout London urban area instead - although even then they'd still prefer something else entirely different instead since preserving such historic structures seems currently too much trouble even though doing so may actually help revitalise their community especially if done well along these lines as an example given their own neighbourhood here - if anything perhaps this could help explain why many residents chose not support restoration efforts as claimed or otherwise continue trying block any such efforts from being carried out now either though despite all those protest efforts Carwardine managed finally gain permission from Westminster Council nearly seven years earlier back on 4 April 1993 for conversion into luxury flats &amp; eventually managed apply successfully under Section 106 Part II Planning Obligations specifically clause 3(&quot;b&quot;)(iv) using Heritage Grant Aid funding towards restoring features such as public access stairways inside tower itself plus much needed major structural repairs outside + external landscaping improvements after agreeing upon buying back lots 1 &amp; 2 comprising 3 acres () around Château via separate deal(s) involving Peter Ashman Ltd., Savills Estate Agents Ltd., Sloane Stanley Estate Agents Ltd., Savernake Estates Ltd., Bracknell Estates Ltd., William Lamb Holdings Ltd., Grosvenor Property Services plc plus final agreement between them all eventually reached following auction held 2 July 1997 for undisclosed sum ; although this deal didn't include restoring main building itself since he still wanted sell/demolish if possible + since none could afford buy whole place outright nor would anyone take place offered price asking price £4m+/- so he kept trying find solution until finally got planning permission first time mentioned above ..... yet despite Peter Carwardine getting planning permission earlier than others mentioned above not intending ever use them too give locals false hope + only ever intended demolish or convert whole place himself either way once listed status removed despite locals not wanting force him do either since knew full well couldn't afford either option themselves ... Ironically enough first version submitted plans drawn up by David McLean Architects proposed converting main building into 70 luxury flats using original stone facade while new feature rooftop garden designed incorporating surviving parts parts existing balcony leading onto main entrance hall inside main structure itself plus created new rooftop garden/courtyard above connecting newer block(s) located near rear end side - all linked together via external staircase leading upwards towards main tower alongside semi circular balcony wrapping around entire top level surrounding same each way ... All except 12 units intended earmarked strictly reserved 'for local community' + linked via underground tunnel system running beneath 10ft deep pond itself built originally mid 19th century purpose use water pumped up floors above via pumps located underneath ground level basement area next door leading round past old stables near rear end wall beside large bay window facing directly onto front garden beyond central lawn area ... While plans submitted 1995 + approved 1997 failed make any mention about restoring historical grounds themselves including perimeter walls nor landscaping gardens nor restoring pool together simply fenced off entire site removing few trees mainly just grassy field surrounded pond itself now dug out soil dumped elsewhere within grounds instead - never mind landscaped grounds anywhere else further away besides next door neighbour Lord North Street where exist today anyway ..... Nowadays most wouldn't even recognise site nowadays anyway even if they did visit/see before since virtually everything demolished stone removed turf removed grass removed replacing pool filled emptied filled emptied again till now barely noticeable unless spot careful look notice brickwork flooring laid bare beneath ..... Some local residents still couldn't accept idea even erecting new flats over top hence why originally wanted keep whole site exactly same way originally planned restore everything original feature minus pool originally used filled sometime late 1980s early 1990s probably soon after Peter Carwardine died whoever responsible responsible doing so chose fill hole back up afterwards filling soil / rubble / waste / junk dumped there instead .... Such constant tampering demolition work slow progress inevitable eventually lead result demolition work stopped short short few feet short days short weeks short months</p>\n",

It has a lot of character and is in an area of the city that is not too crowded, but is close to downtown and all the major attractions. The rooms were clean and comfortable when we arrived. We stayed in two different rooms: one with two double beds and one with a single bed. Both were large enough and had enough space to store our suitcases and other things we needed for our stay. The breakfast was decent but could have been better. There is a nice porch that overlooks the river that we enjoyed sitting out on in the evenings, which was nice even though it was cooler than we would like because it had such a great ambiance. (Hotel guests get their own key to come and go as they please.) We did not use the pool or the hot tub, but it seemed like they were well-kept and utilized by many hotel guests at all hours of the day (and night). Overall, I think this is a good hotel with some room for improvement (the breakfast especially), but I would recommend staying here if you want something more unique than most hotels in this area of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>&quot;Wonderful historic district stay with fantastic service!&quot; 5 by Andrew M on 10-02-2015 We loved our stay at The Green House Inn!</p>\n<p>We loved our stay at The Green House Inn! 5 by Andrew M on 10-02-2015 We loved our stay at The Green House Inn!</p>\n<p>Inn at Carrollton 4 by Angela R on 09-29-2015 Nice place to relax!

They also offer apartments nearby starting at €130 per night for two people sharing one room plus €30 per person past two people sharing one room)</p>\n<p>Eating in Venice</p>\n<p>Venice offers world cuisine served by waiters who are often dressed in costume in atmospheric settings overlooking canals teeming with gondolas. Reservations are smart during peak times such as lunchtime near Piazza San Marco or dinner time when cruise ships are docked nearby. On busy nights many restaurants require reservations even for drinks at their bar before dinner or drinks afterward. Thanks largely to cruise ships that fill this town several times daily throughout summer months, Venice is notorious for its skyrocketing prices...and tourists happily pay them! But because I feel guilty overcharging tourists who may come once but never come back again because I gouged them too much...I keep an eye out for affordable alternatives wherever possible below! Remember: When ordering zuppa di pesce “fish soup” here, there’s no need to pick just one fish out of dozens swimming around your bowl like it’s Noah’s Ark! Venetians proudly sample everything swimming around your plate...and enjoy watching tourists get squeamish over the same dish! Remember: If diners order more than one selection off any menu liste dei vini “wine list” offered by Venetian eateries today...they must pay extra per glass even if they share their bottle among three people! This practice helps diners avoid ordering wine by the glass which would require them ordering food as well because restaurants usually do not receive enough money back from their markup of wine by the glass compared with bottles ordered by diners who consume them entirely themselves while sharing their bottle among three people at table!</p>\n<p>PONTE VECCHIO MARKET AND NEARBY FERRY TERMINALS</p>\n<p>(See “Restaurants &amp; Bars near Rialto Bridge &amp; Ponte Rialto” map, here.)</p>\n<p>The touristy zone surrounding Ponte Vecchio bridge offers grand views over this famous bridge as well as easy access by foot or boat across Venice’s Grand Canal and into its historic core (described next). The area between Rialto Bridge and Stazione Marittima is lined with tourist traps serving mediocre food at inflated prices: lots of drab pizzerias serving plasticky pizza slices wrapped up like burritos; touristy restaurants similar looking inside and out offering mediocre pasta dishes mostly composed of canned ingredients imported from North America such as corn kernels cut off cobs bound together like corn cobs bound together like books bound together like toilet paper rolls bound together like cakes bound together like socks bound together like underwear bound together...you get my drift...with meatballs produced via industrial machines under sterile conditions that may appear appetizing but lack freshness and flavor; profiteroles filled with ice cream shipped over frozen from Brussels just hours ago instead of being made locally using local ingredients just moments ago using authentic methods handed down through generations since cuisine was invented here centuries ago—and served alongside canned whipped cream produced under industrial conditions miles away rather than peaches ripened right under your nose last summer readymade whipped cream right off some cow somewhere else far far far away ummmmmm interesting....All these places make good photos but unsatisfying meals. They charge outrageous prices because they know tourists won’t know any better until after their first bite into what appears perfectly normal on first glance yet turns out surprisingly bland on first bite! These places appeal more to wallets than taste buds: Tourists eat here having fallen victim first not only because I point out how bad these places really are but also because they don't know that eating well doesn't necessarily mean eating expensively all day long! While many locals dine affordably elsewhere before coming here only as tourists do later after dark once these joints have been deserted by locals who have gone home full after dining cheaply elsewhere all day long....So remember: If you go here hungry before being seduced into overpaying later after dark by this area's glitzy facade alone then maybe you can save some money while still getting good food late enough after dark once everyone else has left....My advice? Eat this way during daylight hours before being lured into staying too late into evening where everything seems glitzy yet pricey once again....That said let me share my favorite eateries near Rialto Bridge....</p>\n<p>Ristorante Trattoria Alla Madonna serves quality food affordably late into evening right across from Stazione Marittima ferry terminal TI desk inside Barovier Palace facing Doge's Palace (see map on here). Choose between seating indoors amid Venetian splendor or outdoors amid pigeons feasting off this zone's human waste seeping under</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/beach/pexels-asad-photo-maldives-1591363.jpg\" alt=\"Suites Virgin Gorda\"></p>\n<p>Suites Virgin Gorda is a sophisticated suites-only resort just steps from the harbor of this laid-back island. The hotel consists of two adjacent buildings, each with its own lobby, pool, restaurant, and bar. The rooms are small but well appointed. The hotel is located across the harbor from the Westin and Little Dix Bay resorts. Scuba diving and sailboat charters are based at the nearby Yacht Harbour.</p>\n<pre><code>\t\t \t\t\t\tLittle Dix Bay\n\n\t\t \t\t\t\tThe Westin Resort ★★★ LUXURY RESORT Little Dix Bay is a collection of low-rise buildings scattered along miles of beachfront (with no beach), only one mile from the airport; it’s ideal for divers who don’t need to be on-site for early flights. The dining options range from an informal beach grill to one of the island’s best French restaurants (no surprise, given that chef Jean-Louis Palladin was the resort’s consulting chef until his death). The rooms are among Virgin Gorda’s largest, with large windows providing views over the nearby North Sound or out to sea; some have balconies or terraces with chairs to enjoy them.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The British Virgin Islands</p>\n<p>Grand Turk Island</p>\n<p>Grand Turk Island ★★</p>\n<p>ATTRACTIONS: Dolphin Encounters; East End Snorkeling; South Beach Snorkeling; Salt Raker Sailing Adventures; Tropical Adventures Sailing School &amp; Cruise Co.; Wall to Wall Watersports Centre.</p>\n<p>Grand Turk has been on cruise lines’ itineraries since before it had a port, so they all use facilities in Cockburn Town only a few minutes from the dock by taxi. In recent years, development has crept up around Cockburn Town and cruise lines have begun offering excursions here as well as in more remote areas such as West Bay and East End Bay—all within a few minutes of downtown by taxi or on foot. There is a visitor center on Main Street near Cockburn Town Harbour where you can get maps and information about Grand Turk attractions ranging from beaches to birding sites to offshore snorkeling sites full of colorful fish and coral reefs that tower more than 60 ft/20m above the surface (see “Snorkeling &amp; Scuba Diving,” below). In town you can also get fishing licenses—an excellent way for nonfishermen aboard ships not equipped with fishing gear or crew members not permitted to fish to try their hand at catching some amberjack, snapper, grouper, wahoo, tuna—even shark if you dare! It costs $5 per person per day for residents ($10 per day for nonresidents) and is good for 24 hours before sunset when you buy it. Fishing tours are also available through several operators in town (see “Guided Tours &amp; Excursions in Grand Turk Island” below). Other than that there isn’t much else in town except lots of souvenir shops selling T-shirts and trinkets aimed at tourists—the same ones you find in every port in every Caribbean island chain with one exception: Grand Turk does have its own branch of Tropicana Juice Factory so if you miss your Tropicana Orange Juice in your morning cereal back home there is no need to worry about that here! If you want something more substantial than frozen yogurt or ice cream bars look for “Kitty Kotch Market Place” which is near Kitty Kotch restaurant (see below), less than 5 minutes walking time out of town toward East End Bay but within walking distance of most cruisers staying in town. They serve breakfast here starting at 8am daily which includes fresh coffee made fresh daily by their resident barista! Kitty Kotch Market Place also offers sandwiches and an assortment of salads served all day long (they even make their own dressings fresh daily), plus hamburgers and hot dogs served until closing time (around 6pm) daily too! If you are staying on board your ship while docked at Grand Turk many ships will offer shoreside dining options ranging from sit-down meals at local restaurants to simple snacks available 24 hours a day which are usually located near tender stations so passengers can get off quickly after docking without having to walk too far away from ship berths during their stay ashore before getting back onboard again later that night once tenders have returned after last call! If your ship offers an optional gratuity package included during shoreside dining while docked here then consider adding an extra tip onto it if food service was excellent since waiters depend on them too since they make up almost all their income while working during this short stay period onboard Big Red Boat vessels sailing between here &amp; ports further down south along this side of Grand Bahama Bank including Half Moon Cay Bahamas! However do check any gratuities added onto the optional gratuity package offered onboard first because sometimes these optional tips included into these packages equal or exceed what waiters would normally receive anyway while working onboard cruise ships especially cruisers who purchase these optional tips offered onboard since they don't know how much waiters would normally receive anyway if they did not purchase this gratuity package offered onboard first! If your company offers complimentary tips then leave no less than 15% extra when paying your final bill which should include any tips already included into your bill either automatically by computerized bill program onboard or added manually by staff working during this short stay period when cruise ships temporarily anchor offshore waiting for next tender call time when passengers will be shuttled ashore using large passenger tenders capable holding hundreds of passengers riding between ship berths &amp; shoreline especially during high season when many people want to visit this port together onboard various ships visiting different ports including Turks &amp; Caicos Islands located just north across ocean waters along eastern side including Providenciales Island where most companies headquartered in Miami Florida USA home office reside including Carnival Cruise Lines whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #1 where all Carnival Cruise Line vessels homeport including Holland America Line whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #2 where all Holland America Line vessels homeport including Princess Cruises whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #3 where all Princess Cruises vessels homeport including Royal Caribbean International whose headquarters reside right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #4 where all Royal Caribbean International vessels homeport plus Norwegian Cruise Line whose headquarters resides right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #5 where all Norwegian Cruise Line vessels homeport plus Disney Cruise Line whose headquarters resides right across Biscayne Boulevard directly behind Port Everglades Cruise Terminal #6 where all Disney Cruises Ltd. vessels start sailing plus Carnival Corporation located along NW 4th Avenue just 2 blocks east south past downtown Miami International Airport located between NW 36th Street &amp; NW 37th Street depending upon whether street numbers start counting upwards or downwards once crossing NW 37th Street which intersects with US 1 US Highway South dividing N/NW/NE/SE quadrants northwards toward Key Largo Florida Keys starting northbound off Florida Turnpike Interstate 95 North Beltway crossing under MacArthur Causeway Tunnel passing next block eastward alongside NE 2nd Avenue heading eastward toward Bal Harbour Shops Mall complex via NE 2nd Avenue turning southbound along US 1 US Highway South next block westward alongside N Miami Avenue until reaching Alton Road again crossing under MacArthur Causeway Bridge heading westward toward Downtown Miami taking final turn southbound onto W Flagler Street then proceeding southbound along SW 8th Street until reaching SW 3rd Avenue then turning eastbound onto SW 3rd Avenue then crossing I-95 Interstate 95 North Beltway via Seybold Interchange Bridge turning northbound off highway entering Downtown Miami passing NW 14th Street turning eastbound along NW 14th Terrace crossing under I-95 Interstate 95 North Beltway Bridge heading eastward toward Virginia Key Channel passing over Water Taxi operating between Virginia Key Marina located adjacent southeast side Virginia Key Channel Bridge landing docks alongside downtown Miami Sunset Harbour district dock facilities then terminating northeast corner Virginia Key Channel Bridge landing docks alongside downtown Miami Sunset Harbour district dock facilities terminating ferry terminal dock facility entrance turnaround loop docking next northern end Rickenbacker Causeway Bridge landing docks alongside Haulover Park neighborhood marina facilities terminating main recreational activities area recreational vehicles parking lots adjacent northwest side causeway bridge landing docks alongside Haulover Park neighborhood marina facilities stopping point before continuing westward out Everglades National Park via S Watson Road heading northbound off highway passing underneath toll booths continuing northward through open countryside passing empty fields farms agricultural lands open pasture lands empty pastures Highway 332 interchange exiting city limits as far as southern tip Alligator Alley before heading northwest off highway W Krome Avenue exiting city limits as far as Krome</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/plains/pexels-antony-trivet-6056804.jpg\" alt=\"Lodge Rift Valley\"></p>\n<p>Lodge Rift Valley is a isolated lodge in the game that you can visit. It is located in the Rift Valley area in Africa.</p>\n<p>Contents show]</p>\n<p>Layout Edit</p>\n<p>It has a well-equipped laboratory, a store, and three bungalows. There are also three NPCs than can talk to the player: two scientists and the owner, who you must find to unlock the store.</p>\n<p>There are three bungalows available for rent for $350 each week. The NPC Scientist appears when you rent one of them after finding him in this location. You can also buy food, weapons or ammunition from the owner once he unlocks his store. One of his best selling weapons is the AK-47 with 1000 rounds for $1500 total. He can sell armor and attachments too but they're not as good as what you can find at other locations in Africa. There are also three crates near the bungalows that contain random loot such as ammo or guns but this loot will respawn two weeks after it's collected thus making it risky to collect if other players are nearby since they may get mad if they see you collecting another players loot! Be very careful when collecting these crates! If you decide to take one of these crates outside of this area do not bring it back inside because you'll lose it forever since it will be considered stolen property! There are no survivors here except for an NPC called Scientist that appears after renting one of the bungalows or killing all of them then approaching him while aiming a gun at him while he's lying on ground dead. The scientist has a unique skin which is black instead of white so he's different from other survivors encountered during your journey through Africa! Scientists have their own unique clothing which looks really cool so they're perfect for wearing while playing multiplayer with other players! If you decide to go inside one of these bungalows be aware that there's no bed here! Also beware that there's no toilet either so therefore there's no option to sleep or poop here! Scientists have their own unique clothing which looks really cool so they're perfect for wearing while playing multiplayer with other players! If your character has diarrhea then it is advised that you leave this area immediately because there's nothing here that will cure it and if your character dies from this disease then you'll be forced to respawn back at camp and lose some days worth of supplies such as food and water which is very annoying since dying from disease is avoidable by simply staying away from places like this where there aren't any toilets or medicine stations available at all! This is why this place isn't recommendable by many players who prefer places like Fort Knocks instead because Fort Knocks has toilets and medicine stations where characters with diarrhea can get cured without risking their lives by trying out risky actions such as camping here in Rift Valley where there aren't any toilets or any way to cure diarrhea whatsoever! So remember that staying away from areas like this during your journey through Africa will save lots of time and resources such as food and water since dying from diarrhea means losing multiple days worth of supplies which may result in starvation if enough time passes by without encountering any supplies on your way towards Capital City so always remember to stay away from places like these until reaching Capital City where all resources respawn but only during night time when nobody else will see your character doing something smelly like using a toilet in public because using a toilet in public isn't allowed otherwise people might think your character is mentally retarded since toilets aren't meant for public use but only at home where nobody except members of your household can see what's going on inside a toilet bowl if someone actually uses one which isn't recommended either due to health reasons but still some people may try out things like that just to avoid going outside during night time when nobody else will see them doing something smelly inside a toilet bowl which could result in getting killed instantly if done outdoors because scavengers hate seeing people doing smelly things outdoors especially during night time when scavengers roam around looking for fresh meat to eat without taking too much risks by hunting humans during daytime cause if someone sees scavengers eating humans then maybe humans will try attacking them causing scavengers being mauled by angry humans thus starving themselves because humans won't give up easily on killing scavengers who hunt humans just for fun among themselves causing scavengers being mauled badly by angry humans causing scavengers becoming weaker while some might even die due to lack of proper nourishment while some others might even go insane being mauled too badly among themselves causing insanity among survivors if enough time passes by yet again causing more chaos among survivors including innocent bystanders resulting into deaths caused by insane mauling survivors along with civilians including children thus creating chaos among civilians including children resulting into

Vanderbilt II, the great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who established the New York Central Railroad. The estate was later sold to Richard Hoyt-Vanderbilt, in 1937, whose family owned it until 1987 when they sold it to Rolf Sachs and his wife. Sachs had a vision to restore the property back to its original grandeur and hired Italian architect Annamaria Cipriani (no relation) and designer Jack Lenor Larsen to redesign and decorate the property into a luxurious five star hotel and restaurant. After six years of extensive renovations, Château Cipriani opened its doors as a luxury hotel and restaurant on December 13, 1993. The French chateau style mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of its Beaux-Arts architecture theme.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/city/pexels-felix-haumann-3626248.jpg\" alt=\"Château Bristol\"></p>\n<p>Château Bristol is a charming château located in Loches, Indre-et-Loire, France. It is one of the Loire Valley’s more attractive châteaux.</p>\n<p>The house was built in 1515 by Jacques d’Amboise, more than likely on the site of an earlier castle. The main body is quite uniform having three stories with slate roofing and large mullioned windows. The round tower has a slate roof with an open lantern topped by an iron balustrade and a stone spire. A smaller square tower stands at each corner of the main block, also with a slate roof and an open lantern topped by a finial.</p>\n<p>The château was purchased in 1604 by Maurice de Bourbon, Duc de Mercoeur but he died shortly thereafter and it then passed to his daughter Marie de Bourbon who became Duchess of Mercœur when she married Henri II d’Orléans in 1607. In 1608 her husband began renovations which included adding a much larger wing onto the north end of the original building, adding dormer windows to the top floor, and extending the cellars beneath the ground floor to accommodate his large wine collection which he had begun collecting in 1603 when he purchased Château du Clos-Lucé in Amboise from Leonardo da Vinci for 100 000 livres after hearing that he was going blind. It was at this time that he also began using tools from Leonardo's workshop to build furniture which still exists today including a magnificent dining table that seats 24 carved from solid walnut wood with detailed carvings of lions heads holding up each corner and Vanitas symbols such as frogs, skulls, hour glasses and timepieces carved into its surface. In 1609 there were plans for further expansion but these were never realized due to lack of funds. He did however add two wings on either side of the courtyard making it U shaped resulting in its present layout with one wing used as living quarters while another served as stables and quarters for his staff (one wing has since been demolished).</p>\n<p>In 1815 Château Bristol passed into private ownership when it was purchased by Henri Drouin de Lhuys who added two large wings onto either side of the courtyard giving it its current U-shaped layout (the wings were demolished in 1902). In 1866 it came into possession of Ernest Callet who commissioned further additions by architect Jules Brindejonc des Moulinais including additional living quarters on top of an attic space built during Callet's ownership (the attic space is not visible from street level). During this time period Callet installed fountains and brought back garden terraces around the château which had been removed during previous renovations done under Drouin de Lhuys' ownership (these terraces can be seen today behind trees that line both sides of rue du Chateau). In 1920 Louis Blain bought Chateau Bristol but did not live there for long before renting out most rooms to wealthy tenants until his death in 1941 when it became state property until 1944 when it was sold once again to Edmond Sautter who lived there until 1950 before renting out rooms again until 1960 when he died leaving his wife Andrée Sautter as sole owner who lived there until her death in 1972 after which her son inherited ownership before selling it again to Gérard Castelot-Notrejean who owned Chateau Bristol until 1989 when he sold it once again leaving its current owners Michel Rousselot &amp; Marie-France Rousselot - De la Houssaye as current owners since 1990 after purchasing Chateau Bristol for 1 million francs.</p>\n",

A thin strip of sandy beach is the perfect spot for bodysurfing, swimming, and building sand castles; on the other side of the camp you’ll find rocky tide pools full of sea life. The camp itself is set among mature trees on a terraced hillside above the bay—it feels like you’ve stumbled upon your own private hideaway. There are two saltwater pools (one heated), a big hot tub that sometimes bubbles with fresh herbs, and two open-air massage huts. Meals are served in an open-air dining room with panoramic views. The spacious cabins (and villas) are decorated in earthy tropical colors, with handcrafted furnishings including four-poster beds and handwoven rugs; most have private terraces or patios overlooking the sea. Pros: pretty location; great service; excellent food; free Wi-Fi in public spaces Cons: high humidity makes for sticky nights inside some rooms | Rooms from: $1045 | Calle Principal | 23402 | 52/984–835–7005 | <a href=\"http://www.sanignacio.com\">www.sanignacio.com</a> | 8 rooms, 6 villas | All meals.</p>\n<p>Previous Chapter | Beginning of Chapter | Next Chapter | Table of Contents</p>\n<p>Main Table of Contents</p>\n<p>Getting Here and Around</p>\n<p>Essentials</p>\n<p>Next Chapter | Table of Contents</p>\n<p>Air Travel | Boat Travel | Bus Travel | Car Travel</p>\n<pre><code> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\tPrevious Chapter | Next Chapter | Table of Contents\n\n\t\t \t\tPrevious Chapter | Next Chapter | Table of Contents\n\n \t The Yucatán Peninsula is a world unto itself, with a distinct culture and language, a unique history, and a climate unlike any other in Mexico—except perhaps for its neighbor to the south in Central America: humid and hot year-round without much variation from season to season. In fact, it’s hard to think about Mexico without thinking about its tropical weather—and nowhere is that more evident than in this peninsula where temperatures remain at or above 70°F from November through April (expect brief dips into the mid-60s at night). During periods known as inviernos (winters) from May through October morning fogs creep across the jungle floor as temperatures hover around 70°F during the day before climbing to 85°F by day’s end—but again dropping only slightly at night to an even warmer 80°F or so. If you come expecting snowstorms or wintry chills like those that mark winter back home, you might be disappointed at first glance—but give it time: there may be no snow here but there are plenty of ways to get into your own kind of chill while visiting this warmest part of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Air Travel</p>\n<p>Aeropuerto Benito Juárez (BQN) was formerly known as Aeropuerto de Mérida (MID), but has recently been renamed after Benito Juárez who was born in Mérida in 1806 and went on to become president of Mexico once he left his birthplace behind for good when he was just 15 years old! He returned many years later as president to work on infrastructure projects such as roads and railways throughout his country before being assassinated just three years after taking office again! This little history lesson comes courtesy not only due to BQN Airport’s name change but also because spending time here waiting for your flight offers plenty more details about Banderas Bay than you can get from reading hotel brochures alone! After all any airport offers far more than just flights these days! Gone are the days when we had nothing but sterile places where we checked our bags before we boarded our flights—nowadays airports have morphed into mini cities complete with shopping malls complete with restaurants that actually serve real food not just fast food items such as burgers or pizza slices along with other services such as Internet access along with other necessities such as medical clinics both inside AND outside security checkpoints along with changing baby diapers left behind by parents traveling either solo or accompanied by their children too young too travel alone while their parents get stuck inside security areas listening to piped-in music or watching TV while waiting for their flights! As if all this wasn’t enough there are now even movie theaters found within terminal buildings at numerous airports around North America including Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport along with Charlotte Douglas International Airport both located within North Carolina USA along with San Diego International Airport which is located within San Diego California USA just to name just three airports out here in California alone! Once upon a time international airports held captive people who traveled internationally while they waited for their flights—and it felt like forever back then since waiting times were long due primarily due delays which were rampant during those older times especially during holiday seasons particularly Thanksgiving Day when people would wait hours if not longer waiting for their flights home following turkey dinners spent watching football games being played by American football teams across this great land alongside family members whether they lived nearby or thousands if not hundreds thousands miles away depending upon how much travel they did during each year whether living near relatives who traveled frequently each year whether visiting relatives over Christmas break whether taken abroad on vacation trips every summer whether taken abroad on vacation trips every summer although that hasn’t happened since 9/11 since when security levels increased dramatically following terrorist attacks against New York City and Washington D.C. perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists operating out of Afghanistan beginning way back when Bill Clinton was president together alongside his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton who has since gone onto become America’s Secretary Of State although she does still make frequent trips overseas usually heading off somewhere exotic whenever her husband Bill starts getting too close politically speaking especially considering his past extra marital affairs which included Monica Lewinsky who became embroiled in scandal following her affair together alongside then President Bill Clinton until she testified regarding her relationship together alongside him during court proceedings relating directly towards charges brought against him regarding perjury regarding sex trafficking operations involving minors taking place throughout Arkansas USA which he subsequently resigned due primarily due public backlash resulting mainly because many Americans viewed Monica Lewinsky herself as being nothing more than a mere child having been so young herself when she became sexually involved together alongside President Bill Clinton although she turned out ok eventually going onto college becoming an attorney practicing law serving several years working under Hillary Rodham Clinton herself briefly before serving several years working directly under President Barack Obama himself becoming what he calls “a constant source of encouragement over my last four years wearing 2 hats 2 different ways” according to Barack Obama himself speaking live via satellite broadcast on Oprah Winfrey Network last month March 2015 shortly before announcing his candidacy for U.S. presidency 2016 which will take place next November 2016 nearly 3 months after reaching term limit limit once again meaning that Hillary Rodham Clinton will no longer be U.S Secretary Of State unless Barack Obama appoints her yet again should he decide not run again however considering how things seem currently there seems little chance Hillary Rodham Clinton will ever return working under Barack Obama himself assuming she even runs instead opting instead running against him especially considering how popular her husband Bill remains globally speaking today especially still having remained influential worldwide despite having stepped down office 12 years ago now shown by how crowds across globe continue cheering loudly whenever they see him appear especially considering how many younger women especially college coeds have idolized him particularly following Monica Lewinsky scandal since it did nothing whatsoever hurt his popularity polling numbers particularly among younger women today proving beyond any shadow doubt whatsoever that scandals do indeed have value providing huge benefits huge bonuses enormous profits particularly if handled correctly thus proving beyond any shadow doubt whatsoever why Donald Trump wishes desperately wishes

The hotel is in a nice location just outside of the main part of town, about 20 minutes walk to the temple complex and 15 minutes to town center with lots of shops and restaurants along the way. I believe it's also about 15 minutes walk to other parts of town so it's convenient location wise as well. We arrived late evening after spending some time at one of Ayurveda resorts so we were tired but still enjoyed our stay at Naladhu! Our room was very clean and large with all amenities needed including sitting area/balcony which had nice seating area with seating looking out to garden below. We also enjoyed sitting outside on patio just off lobby just relaxing after long day walking around town! Staff were all very nice and helpful as well!! Would definitely recommend this hotel for your visit to Kerala!!</p>\n",

It’s the last and only coastal remains of the giant sand dunes that used to cover most of the South American coastline. The surrounding sea is a translucent turquoise and the water is warm and clean. There are crystal clear waters and gorgeous sunrises. The island has an amazing archaeological site called Cerro Colorado which you can visit for free.</p>\n<p>The area is full of wildlife such as foxes, birds, deer, lizards, flamingos and iguanas. There are also huge numbers of fish here so it’s a great place to go fishing or snorkelling in the sea. You can find some very special and rare species here such as sea lions and dolphins (although they keep their distance). One of the best features is that there are no sharks in this area! If you want to relax with your loved one this location is perfect for you. It will make for an unforgettable experience filled with romance, tranquility and peace.</p>\n<p>There are several retreats on Isla de la Plata but one which stands out from all others is Adalberto Madrigal’s Casa Madrigal retreat (Casa Madrigal), where you will find peace, serenity, comfort, privacy, excellent food (vegetarian options) along with exquisite service (private chef at your service) at reasonable prices (less than US$70 per night per person). They have accommodation options including tipis for couples or family groups to cabanas where you can spend time alone or with your family or friends. The tipis come with mattresses but you need your own sleeping bags (you can rent them there at a low price). The cabanas include beds but it’s good to bring your own sleeping bags if possible because they don’t give blankets (it gets cold at night). You can also rent tents to bring if needed. There are two hot water showers on-site at each accommodation options so it’s not necessary to bring camping gear if you don’t want to. Be aware that there isn’t any electricity on-site so I recommend bringing solar powered torches/lanterns or headlamps if possible if planning on hiking around the island during the night time hours to see different animals like foxes who come out at night looking for food &amp; mates!</p>\n<p>The retreat offers workshops full of information about plant medicine &amp; dietas which I highly recommend doing before coming here if possible since they help you prepare for this journey prior to arrival! If not then there are plenty of workshops once here offered by experts in ayahuasca &amp; other plant medicines which will help provide answers &amp; healing for lots of people who are traveling here from all over the world!</p>\n<p>One thing I really liked about Casa Madrigal was the fact that they have a large number of volunteers who work hard everyday helping guests feel comfortable during their stay by providing them with lots of information about what they offer &amp; how things operate around here! This is important because it helps guests understand what is going on around them instead of being confused about what happens here during their stay which makes them feel more relaxed &amp; happy during their stay!</p>\n",

I would recommend this place if you want to take it easy after your Inca Trail experience!</p>\n<p>Inca Trail Hiking Tips:</p>\n<p>If you have never been hiking before, be sure to take it easy during your hike so that your body can get used to it! It is recommended that you start training before hand so that your body gets used to being active every day for long periods of time! Like anything else in life, starting small allows you to progress into more challenging hikes! When I did my Inca Trail hike, I was able to do about 3-4 hours at a time but eventually was able find ways to increase my time on the trail as well as increase my elevation level on some obstacles by using some certain techniques!! I had never hiked before but was still able to complete this trek within 10 days!! Hiking poles are highly recommended if you are not use to hiking or have had any injuries that may cause pain when walking or running! They offer stability when climbing up hills as well as prevent muscle fatigue by providing some assistance when climbing up hills or stairs!! What time should I wake up? It depends on what pace YOU want but since there are many stops along the way where they offer delicious food (as well as water/tea) along with bathrooms (if needed), there is no need getting up early unless YOU want too!! If you like hiking early then be sure not miss breakfast because they only serve it until 9am!! How many hours do we walk each day? Since there are many stops for food/bathrooms/tea breaks along the way then it depends how long YOU want too!! There are no set times for stopping for lunch/dinner because again YOU decide what pace YOU like!!! How much time should I spend on breaks? Again this depends on YOU!!!!

Do NOT bring regular water bottles they are heavy!!!! What type clothes should I bring? Go light!!!! Bring pants with zip-off legs or shorts with zip-off legs because most nights there are cold breezes!!! Make sure whatever type pants you bring have pockets for toilet tissue if needed….

The main château was built during the 16th century and is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture since 1922.</p>\n<p>The château's history dates back to 1234, when the lands were granted as a fief to Guillaume de Miribel by Hugues des Arcis, Seigneur de Châteaurenard. The castle was enlarged during the 14th and 15th centuries and occupied by Gaston de Béarn, husband of Jeanne d'Auvergne (1429–1464), daughter of Paul III d'Auvergne (1390–1438), Seigneur de Miribel and Comte de Formigny. In 1454, Guillaume III d'Auvergne (1425–1488), son of Paul III, became owner of the château and remained so until his death. In 1568, Anne d'Auvergne (d. 1584), daughter of Guillaume III sold the estate to her cousin Charles II d'Estaing who remained its owner until 1616. From 1616 onwards it remained a possession of the Béarn-Miribel family until it passed into the hands of Claude-Charles du Roy de Saint-Albin in 1780. His descendants owned it up to 1855 when it became property of Mr Léonard Jollivet Victorin who bequeathed it to his son Jean-Marie Jollivet Victorin who subsequently passed it on to his nephew Jacques du Roy d'Armenonville in 1912. The latter had no children and his widow sold Château St Paul's to Mr Lefebvre in 1967 who owned it until 2000 when he gifted it to a not for profit association called &quot;Les Amis du Château Saint-Paul&quot;. Since then restoration works have been undertaken with help from financial organisations such as FNAIM, Fondation du Patrimoine, Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme (FNH) , Agence française pour le développement (AFD) et Eurorégion Rhône Alpes Auvergne - Val de Loire . It was at this time that an outbuilding which had been used as stables was restored to become an area for wine production by La Dilettante where they make their range of Cypriot wines (Anoussa Valley).</p>\n<p>Since 2003 two artists have lived on site at Château St Paul’s: Plasticien Yves Abecassis known for his monumental sculptures &amp; installations made from waste materials; he began working at CHSP in 2003 after meeting Mme la Comtesse Humbert du Roure; Artiste Christophe Jacquet also lives on site with his wife since 2005; both artists are Resident Artists at CHSP since 2013</p>\n",

It has been built in such a way that it blends into the surroundings and does not affect the wildlife, either in appearance or with noise pollution. The Inn is designed for comfort and to enhance the guests’ safari experience by providing an opportunity for interaction with the wild animals right outside one’s bedroom door.</p>\n<p>The design of the Inn has taken into account factors like climate control, solar energy, water harvesting, natural ventilation and waste disposal, among others. The roof of the building is covered with glass panels which let light into the building during day time and also provide a view into the game reserve at night. Inside the rooms there are large windows that allow for views of animals on both sides of them; one side is towards their dens while other side looks out towards more open spaces.</p>\n<p>The rooms are all designed with different themes to give them character. Each has its own outdoor area where guests can relax or dine at leisure. The dining area is located near a waterhole so guests can watch animals drink while they enjoy their meal. There are also viewing decks around this area where guests can sit down to relax after a long day of game drives or simply watch the animals enjoy themselves without feeling like they are intruding on their privacy.</p>\n<p>Another interesting feature of this Inn is that it has its own ecological pest control system that helps keep pests under control without harming any of the local fauna or flora around it. The system works by attracting birds which feed on pests like tsetse flies and termites, thus keeping them under control without using any harmful chemicals or insecticides which could, otherwise affect other species living in these areas as well as pollute this pristine environment further.</p>\n",

It's luxurious, but not overly so. The breakfast buffet is worth the price of admission ($38/person), and the rooms are stunningly decorated.</p>\n<p>Where to Eat in Venice</p>\n<p>Venice has an abundance of local restaurants that are generally reasonably priced. However, there are also a few highly regarded &quot;must-try&quot; restaurants that are worth mentioning. These restaurants tend to be more expensive, but they're special for a reason, and you won't regret trying them at least once.</p>\n<p>Osteria La Caravella is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the world. Located right on Campo Santa Margherita near Campo San Barnaba, La Caravella is one of the most well-known osterias in all of Italy. The food is ridiculously fresh and generally served family style (which makes it easy to share), and you can't beat that view! I have never had a bad meal here, and I have no doubt that this will continue to be my go-to place when I visit Venice in the future. Note: They do not take reservations, so only go if you're okay with waiting for a table! It's worth it though!</p>\n<p>Osteria Enoteca Ai Artisti is another great option for eating out in Venice. It's located near Il Redentore church on Isola di San Michele (which was where we stayed during our trip). This osteria has lovely outdoor seating right on the water as well as indoor seating with traditional Venetian decor inside (including an old piano). The prices aren't too bad either – expect to spend around $20/person for lunch or dinner here (and $35/person for brunch). They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait if you want an outdoor table or come early if you want an indoor table – we waited less than half an hour both times we went there, and we ate late afternoon both times which is typically when many people eat lunch in Venice anyway! Highly recommend this restaurant – it's one of our favorites from our entire trip!</p>\n<p>La Cantina della Birra Artusi is perhaps the most famous restaurant in all of Venice (at least according to TripAdvisor!) Located right on Campo Santa Margherita near Campo San Barnaba, Birra Artusi's claim to fame comes from its beer selection – they brew their own beer using sourdough yeast and serve it alongside traditional Italian food like risotto and handmade pasta that comes straight from their own kitchen (they don't use any pre-made sauces or pastas here). If you're looking for something simple like pizza or pasta though, Birra Artusi probably isn't your best bet since they specialize in more high-end traditional Italian dishes – but it's definitely a must-try if you want to try some local beers while visiting Venice! Note: You can also buy Birra Artusi beers from many other bars throughout Venice too – including at most bars right around Rialto Bridge which makes this restaurant a great stop after doing some sightseeing there! Also note: This restaurant can get quite busy during peak tourist season which means it may take a while before they can seat you – just look at them &amp; smile though since they always seem happy anyway! 🙂</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><img src=\"../../img/jungle/pexels-teguh-sugi-6121916.jpg\" alt=\"Ranch San Ignacio\"></p>\n<p>Ranch San Ignacio is a spiritual ranch; we offer a safe haven to those who are looking for a refuge and refuge is what they will find. The ranch is located in the northern part of the state of Chihuahua, near the town of Mexicali, Baja California. It is open to those who want to experience one of the most powerful and profound healings that exist on this earth: shamanic healing.</p>\n<p>The word san means holy and ignacio means saint so san ignacio is holy saint, or sacred healing. We work with many different lineages of shamans all over the world and we honor them all. Our intent is to provide a space for you to connect with your own healing power and discover your own truth and your own connection with God and nature. We offer traditional ceremonies as well as modern shamanic ceremonies that include: ayahuasca, yopo, huachuma, mapacho (ayahuasca vine), sanango (içana), chacruna (chacruna), datura, trompeta (trompetilla), yaje tinshu tusama, tiperuna tinshu tusama , pajaritos de la montaña (little mountain birds) , mihkalimpa , icimapa .</p>\n<p>We also practice reiki, crystal therapy, massage therapy , sound therapy with crystal bowls , craniosacral therapy , bioenergetics therapy, intuitive readings by Tarot cards or cards from other traditions . We have an organic farm where we grow medicinal herbs, organic vegetables and medicinal plants. You can become familiar with these plants during our traditional ceremonies. We have animals on our ranch where people can experience being in contact with animals in their natural environment. There are horses for riding lessons or just plain fun! Dogs that love to play fetch or just lie quietly at your feet while you nap! Cats that will curl up next to you while you meditate! We have chickens so you can learn about eggs from birth until they are ready for breakfast! And there are also goats if you want milk fresh from the goat’s udder or maybe cheese made by yourself!</p>\n<p>We have a beautiful swimming pool where one can relax after a full day of activities…or even before breakfast! Next year there will be hot tubs too because after working hard during ceremonies it feels great to relax in hot water; this heals physically as well as spiritually now doesn’t it? And now imagine this pool surrounded by trees covered with flowers like magnolias blooming pink flowers at the same time as orange jasmines…don’t try too hard…you will see…it’s magic! This place exists because all these things exist within us; it exists within each one of us; it exists within everyone . It exists because it is our natural state….this space created during ceremonies serves as a bridge between our inner world and our outer world….between ourselves and nature….between ourselves and God…because everything that exists outside ourselves exists within ourselves….and this bridge has been created out of love…and love heals . Come explore this bridge together; experience the magic together; live the magic together ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Welcome Home!!!</p>\n",
